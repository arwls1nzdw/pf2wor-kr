Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface — you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest.\nAny large or smaller creature standing in the area where you first conjured the rift must make a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Reflex saving throw{/g} to jump to safety in the nearest open space. In addition, the edges of the rift are sloped, and any creature ending its turn on a square adjacent to the rift must make a Reflex saving throw with a +2 {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} to avoid falling into it. Creatures subjected to an effect intended to push them into the rift (such as bull rush) do not get a saving throw to avoid falling in if they are affected by the pushing effect.\nThe walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid, strange chewing vermin, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}6d6{/g} points of falling {g|Encyclopedia:Damage}damage{/g}. Any creature in the rift (starting on the {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}round{/g} it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift's environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, {g|Encyclopedia:Damage_Type}bludgeoning{/g}, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. To climb the rift's walls, a creature need a successful {g|Encyclopedia:Athletics}Athletics{/g} or {g|Encyclopedia:Mobility}Mobility{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill check{/g} with a {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} of 35.\nWhen this spell's duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift's environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.",
