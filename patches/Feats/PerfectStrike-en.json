You can {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}roll{/g} your attack roll twice and take the higher result. You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special).\nSpecial: A zen archer or quarterstaff master monk receives Perfect Strike as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt an perfect strike attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk."
