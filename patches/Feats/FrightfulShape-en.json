Whenever you make an attack, enemies within 30 feet of you must succeed at a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}Will save{/g} ({g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} 10 + half your {g|Encyclopedia:Character_Level}character level{/g} + your {g|Encyclopedia:Charisma}Charisma{/g} modifier) to resist being affected by your frightful shape. On a failed save, creatures with fewer HD than you become shaken, or frightened if they have 4 HD or fewer; in either case, the effect lasts for a number of {g|Encyclopedia:Combat_Round}rounds{/g} equal to your character level. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw are immune to your frightful shape for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."
