One such horror of an aircraft emerges from the clouds to intercept the Commander's ship. Numerous spikes impaled with writhing, flayed bodies decorate the pirate ship, and it looks like the sails are made of the skins of its unfortunate victims. A huge symbol on the sail indicates that the ship belongs to cultists of Dagon, Shadow Lord of the Sea. With bloodthirsty screams, they advance upon the Commander's vessel.",

Unsurprisingly, the crew is horrified when they notice the first signs of disease spreading on board. In the morning, many sailors find themselves unable to rise to their feet. The afflicted are racked by a merciless fever, and several of those most weakened by the journey have already stopped breathing. Neither spells nor mundane cures seem to help.",

Their pathetic resistance crumbles in an instant, and the sailors return to the ship with sacks full of useful supplies. The corpses of those who were brave enough to fight float adrift on the waves, attracting beasts hungry for fresh meat. Very soon, packs of hungry monsters scale the cliffs, forcing the crew to take off, full sail, and continue on their journey.",

Someone ingenious and cunning stuffed the ruins with sleeping death waiting to be awakened. But thanks to {mf|his|her} concentration and experience, the Commander manages to pass all the traps without setting off a single one.",
    "e369ca04-3801-4652-9b29-288c40a21e21": "The sailors do not turn down the chance to get drunk, but there's no joy in it: the crew members scatter around the deck and drink in glum silence, anticipating their imminent death. In the morning, suffering from sore heads and queasy stomachs, the poor lads fail to notice the nasty tang of the water they guzzle to quench their thirst. By the time they finally discover the stowaway they picked up on Alir — a grotesque mushroom that sprouted paw-like tendrils and climbed into the barrel of drinking water — it is already too late. The disease rips through the crew with the force of a hurricane.",
    "8ae9bcad-3d27-4f99-95ea-a8c44b74204c": "The sailors drag the most terrible poisons, the most dangerous venoms up onto the deck, throw them all into the pot-bellied cauldron, mix them, and pour the mixture out on the attacking vines. But the trick yields no results at all — the vines eagerly suck in the toxic brew pouring from the deck without showing any signs of discomfort. Moreover, they start moving more quickly and the roots' grip on the hull becomes even tighter.",
    "fd4f1b8d-60f8-47c7-9610-14e3b0905747": "The sailors grab their sabers and spread their wings to rise above the deck and repel the enemy, but they cannot match the harpies' flying prowess. Making skillful maneuvers among their enemies, the sweet-voiced predators gut them with their sharp talons, rip their leathery wings, and dig into their vulnerable necks with razor-sharp teeth. A gory feast unfolds in the air, with blood and entrails raining down on the deck. After the harpies finally leave the ship, full-bellied, the survivors drop to the deck where they stood. The enchanting harpies' song still echoes in their ears. They will keep hearing it for many days to come, and even as they sleep at night, the song will drive them to derangement. It will be a long, long time before they finally forget its haunting melody.",
    "2a70e484-891c-40ed-b648-0e6a6c06aa53": "The sailors return with a catch that is quite meager, but still better than nothing. They managed to hunt down and kill a predatory amphibian that was hiding in some grotto. Its meat is tough and it reeks horribly, but it is technically edible. The stew cooked from the meat and melted fat of the quarry proves to be surprisingly nutritious and satisfying. It renews everyone's strength, banishing both their sickness and any nagging pain from old scars. The next morning, the uneasy sailors notice a dozen more creatures like the victim of the previous day's hunt. The beasts scale the coastal rocks, climbing closer and closer to the top of the cliff. Without a doubt, they were drawn here by the death of their kin, and their hungry roar makes the crew return the ship to the air with utmost haste.",
    "b75a3bcc-2d1d-4178-85aa-1d62291f0611": "The sailors, for unknown reasons, show sudden mercy. Instead of hanging the Commander and {mf|his|her} loyal companions from the ship's yardarm, they merely throw them off on a lonely standing rock devoid of any signs of life or greenery. The mutineers were probably reluctant to spill the blood of a Golarian who was well known in Alushinyrra and who was welcome at Nocticula's palace, so they decided it would be better to let hunger and madness finish the job.",
    "7f942a72-6158-4be2-bfcf-108e753d5ca8": "The ship approaching the Commander sails under a banner displaying Hepzamirah's personal emblem. The Commander can already see its crew — silent undead, elite warriors in life and now in death, armed with gleaming blades.",
    "7abfa401-3b88-4bb7-898f-5cfbbe2758b1": "The ship is surrounded by a mess of chopped plants, and the sailors eagerly cut the hard roots binding the vessel to the soil. They work skillfully and ruthlessly, and before long, the vessel rises into the air again, carrying away the Commander and {mf|his|her} depleted crew, drenched in blood and plant sap.",
    "1832565c-1139-4fdd-bab2-8ee8c3bd4334": "The ships clash as boarding hooks fly into the air, bite into the ship, and bind the vessels together with a web of ropes that kill any hope of escape. The boarding pirates launch themselves forward, brandishing their cleavers. The Commander's sailors soar upward to meet them with the firm intention of keeping them away from the deck of their ship.",
    "e42578ed-9691-4e1d-878a-e02b3c9a96b0": "The signs that the Commander follows lead {mf|him|her} to an inconspicuous tomb. Judging by the inscriptions on it, the structure is protected by nothing but helpless threats of revenge upon thieves. However, something was lost in translation — as soon as the Commander opens the tomb, a protective curse is triggered. The invisible bony hands of a dead man squeeze the Commander's head, extinguishing the light of reason from it.",
    "93fb6648-5bc2-4be3-b134-6cfea2079d4b": "The sorceress produces a bundle of amulets and puts them on with visible disgust. Her eyes darken, and an echoing darkness appears in the eyes of the mutineers. Moving like mechanical dolls, they return to their lines and get back to work, but their leader and main instigator staggers to the ship's side and steps off into the void. A second before he hits the water, his trance breaks. With a desperate scream, he tries to spread his wings... but it's too late. Mielarah tears off the amulets and disappears into her cabin. She emerges several hours later, her face pale and her eyes red and puffy.",

More importantly, they threaten imminent death to those who disturb the eternal rest of the deceased. However, while intricately elaborating upon the tragic fate awaiting would-be tomb raiders, the author unwittingly left many clues about the dangers ahead. Using the inscriptions as a macabre guidebook, the Commander manages to lead the sailors unharmed past the most dangerous places.",

Now that might just pique the interest of the Lady in Shadow.",
