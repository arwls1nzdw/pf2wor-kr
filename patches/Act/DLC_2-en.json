No matter how hard he tried to build a barricade at the entrance to the church, it kept collapsing time and time again. When a pew fell on him yet again and pierced his shoulder, he finally gave up and conceded defeat. His wound looked nasty and soon became inflamed.",
    "cc0aa2a2-6694-4b04-b854-365603b3aa15": "Bemir shrugged and started opening graves with surprising equanimity and a lack of respect for the dead. Breaking one slab after another, he calmly dragged out anything valuable, not paying any mind to a cut above his brow caused by a stray shard of stone. It may have been folly — the wound, seemingly a trifle, soon became inflamed, and Bemir lost almost all sight in his left eye.",

Clutching his deep wound, Bemir hurried away.",

Not only did it happen to be full of oil, the tiny letters engraved on its surface spelled out a prayer to {g|Iomedae}Iomedae{/g}.

He told the others that he had chased some scaled beast for a long time, but he couldn't beat it in a fight. Refusing to come back empty-handed, he tried some edible-looking moss growing on the cavern wall. Sadly, a scant minute later, his stomach was hit by a violent spasm.",

Carefully examining and touching everything around him, he discovered holes in the walls, holes that contained darts. This trap for grave robbers could have wounded the escapees or even killed them if not for Bemir's caution.",
    "ea83bd7c-e9b7-4bdf-b69c-7131e3ec344e": "Bemir's limp kept getting worse, worrying his companions. He finally leaned against a wall and hoarsely croaked that he could go no further. A brief examination revealed that the miller's wounds had become inflamed and grown dark and swollen. But the companions were too late to help the big man — he simply stopped breathing.",
    "81434d61-40cb-438e-856e-989af906522e": "Bemir's many cuts and scratches were cleaned, despite his sheepish protests. Judging by the color that returned to his face, it did him some good.",

As his chest slammed hard into the ledge, he clung to it with his maimed hand. Alas, the sickness that he had picked up on the journey had sapped him of his might. Before anyone could reach him, his grip loosened, and Bemir was gone. The dull thud from below left them with no hope.",

After closely studying the talismans and holy symbols on their necks, he smoothly uttered a quick prayer to each of the gods venerated by the dead.

Eventually, whatever illness he had been suffering from finally got to him — he staggered, waved his hands awkwardly, and fell onto the ground. His heart was still before he hit the pavement.",
    "91ac6c9b-f48e-46a1-9c10-c6673e299030": "Brodie muttered a prayer to radiant {g|Iomedae}Iomedae{/g} and fearlessly walked into the cellar. It seemed that the demons' dark magic held no fear for this elderly man who stared death in the face every day. Frowning, he examined the stone altar and, with a single swipe of his shovel, he knocked over the black candles, bloody remains, and bones. He hit the stone with the shovel again and again until the black star shattered under the gravedigger's stubborn assault. He collected the cultists' unholy relics into a bag and went outside, his eyes hard and resolute.",

The gravedigger cut out the fat, mixed it with a handful of ash, and smeared the hands and faces of his companions with the foul-smelling poultice.

Alas, at the last moment, the floorboard under his foot creaked, and the robber dodged the blow. He then pulled out a dagger, its blade coated in some foul-smelling oil, and coolly slashed Brodie's shoulder. His friends grabbed the loot and ran.",

What pain, what despair it conveyed! It was not music but the scream of a wounded animal sensing its death. The shoulders of those who heard it slumped as if yet another burden had been added to them. Yet nobody dared to interrupt the musician — his pale and twisted face was too terrible to behold.",
