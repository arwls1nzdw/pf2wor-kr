Iz was not the capital of Sarkoris, and there has never been a throne there. The man who came to the Commander claiming his right to a non-existent throne is so obviously an imposter, it's ridiculous. But the Commander seems to like jokes. Well, let's see how much fun a fool king from the tavern will bring to Drezen.",

Of course, this is not the most reasonable of activities to pursue in the middle of a crusade... But the Commander has proven that success can be achieved not only via the straight path of reason and logic, but also via the more winding path of intuition."
