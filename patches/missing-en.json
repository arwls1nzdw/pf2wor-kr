He took many slaves — as well as a few apprentices to help keep the slaves in line. More importantly, Jennes was armed with a mighty artifact — a glove that could fire deadly rays and crush the bones of rebels like eggshells.\nAmong the slaves was an old craftsman, a halfling by the name of Reed, valued not for his strength, but for his knowledge — he had spent many years excavating starship ruins, and he was well versed in both magic and technology. While the other slaves scoured the plains in search of the mysterious artifact, Reed secretly watched the master and his minions, plotting an escape. Finally, in the dead of night, the slaves managed to steal away the magic glove from Jennes's tent. After digging into the elaborate mechanism, Reed disabled the defense circuit and gave the artifact to the youngest and strongest of the slaves.\nIt took mere minutes for the young slave to eradicate the Technic League arcanists. But when his comrades asked to be unchained, the young man grinned. \"Set you free? Why, now that I'm a free man, I'll need my own slaves!\"\nHearing this, Reed sighed heavily, drew a small remote control from his pocket, and pressed its button. The glove shattered in a powerful explosion, scattering shards of the artifact all over Glenebon. As for the former slaves, they found shelter and freedom in the River Kingdoms.",

The supporters of this ludicrous belief must be mistaking war for a tourney where fighters clash in mock battles, their swords clanging against shields as they avoid striking at the stomach or the head for fear of inadvertently delivering a mortal blow — in other words, achieving what would be their goal in real combat. Unlike mock fights, real war is a continuation of politics that utilizes force with the purpose of establishing the dominion of one group of people over another. And since power is the origin point of all morality, it goes without saying that no moral standards that may be customary in everyday life can impose limitations on power struggles — for the victor will be the one who determines those same standards.\nWhen one wants to catch fish, one goes to the river, and when one wants to hunt game, ones goes to the forest — the natural habitat of one's prey, where it feeds, breeds, and rests. So if the prey is a human being, where else is one to go if not to the city? The city is where laws are passed, deals are made, treatises are written, and songs are composed. While pursuing the goal of subjugating a hostile society, one must begin by attacking its cities instead of wasting time maneuvering one army around another.\"",

According to draconic lore, he and his mate, Tiamat, spawned the dragon-gods who created the whole world. Apsu is the patron deity of all good and metallic dragons. He remains a father figure to almost all dragons, whom he loves as his children. He is numbered among the divine creatures which fought in the battle to defend all of creation against Rovagug.\nUnsurprisingly, most of Apsu's worshipers are metallic dragons. Few non-dragons take up his cause, although honorable humanoids with an interest in draconic lore have taken up his faith from time to time. They typically wear a gold dragon's foot brooch, or have other custom-made equipment in the shape of a dragon's foot.\nGolarion lacks much of a centralized church of Apsu. The largest congregation of humanoid Apsu worshipers on Golarion is known as The Platinum Band, which maintains relatively small centers of worship in Oppara and Absalom.",

Each of these Midnight Isles represents a demon lord or other notable entity she's assassinated — with each new kill, her realm grows. The other demon lords treat Nocticula with a mixture of obsession and fear.

As punishment, the Prince of Darkness inscribed his own symbol on the minotaur lord's brow with the nail of his index finger and imprisoned him in a maze so cunningly crafted that Asmodeus declared it unsolvable. In this act, the Lord of Hell overstepped. The cunning Baphomet not only solved the maze after only a decade, he stole the labyrinth itself from Hell, taking it with him when he returned to the Abyss. Baphomet claimed this new realm for himself. He plots and schemes from his redoubt to return to Hell, this time not to steal from Asmodeus, but to slay him.",

They recruit mortal life only if such cohorts speed along the eventual destruction of hope and goodness. Death is, in some ways, their enemy — for a mortal who dies can often escape a demon's depredations and flee to their just reward in the afterlife.

These witch hunters were often self-styled, their tactics little more than brutal trial and error. The least bit of \"evidence\" could mark a target for investigation — a club foot, a thick accent, or even a \"suspicious\" absence of abnormalities. The witch hunter groups gained reputations for being cruel and arbitrary, although these weren't always deserved. Demons ranged freely across the Worldwound and often spilled into Mendev. Demonic possession did happen, though not nearly as often as the witch hunters claimed. Genuine witch hunters used divination magic and cautious investigation to draw out and destroy fiends, but they were rare compared to the zealous inquisitors who burned innocents at the stake. With the advent of the Fourth Crusade, the authorities took strong measures to end the bloody witch hunts of Mendev. Since then, the frequency of hunts has dropped considerably.",

Almost nothing is known about her life before the atrocity, except that Vorlesh was condemned for using arcane magic, which was persecuted in Sarkoris, and imprisoned in the tower of Threshold near the city of Iz. This is where Areelu Vorlesh conducted the ritual that paved the way for the demonic invasion and left her land to be tormented by the demon lord Deskari. By some mysterious means, the witch transformed herself, changing from an ordinary human into a half-demon. Over the following century, crusaders encountered Areelu Vorlesh or the results of her experiments a few times, but they learned nothing more of Deskari's henchwoman.

However, this protection ended with Aroden's death in 4606. The same year, the Worldwound was opened by the witch Areelu Vorlesh working in conjunction with her demonic patron, Deskari. Demons poured out and overran the barbarian nation of Sarkoris. The Worldwound was not large at first, but soon it abruptly expanded. As it kept growing, it came to be seen as a threat to the entire world.\nThe remaining clerics of Aroden and the clerics of his follower Iomedae took it upon themselves to defeat the demons and seal the Worldwound. Answering their call, thousands of pilgrim crusaders flooded up the River Road and into Mendev, the nearest neighboring kingdom of former Sarkoris. Thus the Mendevian Crusades were born.",

He possessed anything he could ever wish for in ample supply — money, fertile lands, slaves — but envy still gnawed at him, for his neighbor had even more. With the dream of destroying his rival, the man raised a prayer to Famine, one of the Four Horsemen — dreadful deities who were worshiped in Koloran. The deity demanded bloody sacrifice, and the rich man was all too happy to obey. He wrote his agreement with the Horseman on skin ripped from a living cyclops — one of his slaves — and signed it with his own blood. Famine signed the agreement as well, and in an instant, the neighbor's fields and orchards were filled with swarms of rats.\nThe rich man rejoiced, but not for long — after decimating the neighbor's crops, the rats moved on to his own lands. So the man prayed to another Horseman, War, for help. The deity demanded their agreement be written on the skin of the rich man's favorite servant — an old butler who'd served the family his entire life. The rich man felt pity for his old friend, but he had to act quickly. So he skinned his butler, and as soon as War signed the agreement, packs of wolves rushed into his lands. The wolves quickly devoured the rats, and then began attacking the slaves.\nSeeing his riches melting away, the rich man appealed to the third Horseman, Pestilence, for help. To eliminate the wolves, Pestilence demanded that the rich man sacrifice his concubines. The rich man loved his women very much, but he valued his lands more. After the agreement was signed on the concubines' skins, Pestilence unleashed swarms of flies upon the estate. The flies began spreading all kinds of disease, wiping out animals and cyclopes alike.\nAs the rich man pulled his hair out in despair, the fourth Horseman, Death, came with a proposal to return all of his riches in exchange for the lives of all of his family. After the man skinned his loved ones, Death signed the agreement, and all who'd died previously rose once again — the rich man's slaves, the flies, the wolves, the rats, and even the trees in his orchards. They were all vicious undead now. Once the emperor learned of this, he sent his guards to the estate, and after a series of long and difficult battles, they burned the estate to the ground. A cloak was crafted from the skins that had been used for the vile agreements. The emperor's guards placed the cloak around the rich man's shoulders and chased him through all of Koloran with whips until the cloak and the flesh it covered had been torn to tatters. That would have been the end of this story, but after thousands of years, someone found the pieces of this cloak and restored it, deciding to play with dark powers at their own peril...",

In a gambit lasting generations, the Lord of the Locust Host established multiple cults throughout northeast Avistan, culminating in the transformation of the mightiest of his priests into the Echo of Deskari, an avatar who could bring Deskari to Sarkoris and tear a hole in reality to the Rasping Rifts. Only the god Aroden's direct intervention foiled the scheme — Aroden drove the Echo of Deskari and his armies into the Lake of Mists and Veils in 4433. Since then, the Echo has relentlessly hated humanity and Aroden's followers in particular.",

Eventually, the bandits settled in Pitax permanently, building walls around the village, hiring sellswords to help defend against their enemies, and crowning themselves kings of a newfound realm. With this, Pitax became a permanent fixture of the River Kingdoms, able to survive and thrive for nearly four centuries while others around it withered and decayed.",

While today the name of the Crusader Queen is known throughout the Inner Sea region, it's easy to forget that Galfrey did not start her rule of Mendev as a paladin of Iomedae, but rather of Aroden. When the Worldwound opened and forever changed Mendev, Galfrey was still an untested young ruler who was forced to deal with the death of her god while simultaneously rallying her nation against the Abyssal threat to the west. She rose to the challenge, however, and her leadership was instrumental over the next several years, not only in protecting Mendev from demonic invasions, but also in holding the border against the Worldwound. When the church of Iomedae organized the First Crusade, it joined forces with Mendev to push back the demon armies. During these battles, Galfrey time and time again distinguished herself with a keen grasp of tactics and skill at leadership. But this inspiration went both ways — in the church of Iomedae, Galfrey found something to replace her lost faith. By the time the First Crusade ended with the apparent defeat of the demon armies, Galfrey had converted and become a worshiper of Iomedae, and had completely retrained herself as one of the Inheritor's most devout paladins. Eager to retain such a valuable leader at the head of the crusades, the church of Iomedae twice purchased and presented to the Queen the rare and expensive sun orchid elixir, which extends mortal life beyond its usual span. Thanks to this boon, the Queen has lived and led the crusaders for more than a century.",

Iskafi was renowned for his skill, but his life's ambition was not merely to create, but to manifest the will of Sarenrae in steel and fire. The Dawnflower had appeared to him in dreams, guiding him in the crafting of a weapon that would be more than metal—a symbol of her radiant power and relentless pursuit of good.\nWorking tirelessly under the desert sun, Iskafi spent years toiling in his forge, praying, and making offerings to Sarenrae as he worked. He used a unique alloy of sunforged steel, said to have been smelted under the rays of the midday sun and quenched in blessed water from the sacred oasis of Sarenrae. He worked the metal by the light of dawn, believing that the first light of the day was a blessing from the Dawnflower herself.\nAs the final touch, a high priest of Sarenrae enchanted the blade, imbuing it with a fragment of the Dawnflower's divine energy. The completed greatsword radiated warmth and a comforting golden light. Its blade was named the Blade of the Dawnflower, and it was as much a symbol of Sarenrae's glory as it was a weapon.\nOver the centuries, the Blade of the Dawnflower has been wielded by devout warriors, paladins, and heroes in the service of good and light, used to thwart darkness, vanquish the undead, and dispel evil. The Blade is said to recognize the purity of its wielder's intent and shines brightest in the hands of those who fight in Sarenrae's name. Legends say it has turned the tide of countless battles and even halted the advance of armies of darkness.\nEven now, the Blade of the Dawnflower is said to answer the call of a worthy hero—one who is ready to carry the Dawnflower's light into the darkest places and challenge the forces that threaten to overshadow the world. The Blade remains a beacon of hope and a testament to Sarenrae's endless compassion and pursuit of redemption and righteousness.",

At its height, it dominated all of northwestern Garund and also parts of southwestern Avistan. Raids of desert nomads and attacks by powerful outsiders from -3300 onward, and the lack of a strong eastern trade route, led to the slow decline of Jistka.\nOsirion, then a burgeoning kingdom under the control of the powerful Pharaoh of Forgotten Plagues, pushed westward. It overthrew the already weakened Jistka, and the Imperium was plunged into numerous succession wars around -2764, from which it was never again able to recover its former political, military, and economic power. Because of this military and economic defeat, the important cultural, magical, and technological advances of the Jistka Imperium were largely lost and forgotten.",

A few years before the prophesied return of Aroden, stirrings of demonic cults began there. Sarkoris's strange mystics made grim predictions of the nation's fall, however, the people were mostly confident that Aroden's return would directly lead to a final end of these cults. Unfortunately, the mystics were proven correct.\nThe death of Aroden in 4606 saw the appearance of the Worldwound, a gaping gateway to the Abyss, in the heart of Sarkoris. The nearby city of Iz was the first to fall to demonic forces. At first it seemed that there still was a chance to stop the invasion, but in 4638 the Worldwound abruptly expanded. The rest of the clan-holds soon fell. The very land became warped and twisted, and demons continued to spew forth from the Worldwound. The church of Iomedae declared the Mendevian Crusades in order to drive back the demons. However, whilst they have been somewhat successful in containing the threat, Sarkoris itself remains firmly under demonic control.",

The youngest child of a noble family that had fallen on hard times, the only inheritance he could count on was a horse, a suit of armor, and the family sword. Since childhood, the knight had been haunted by a voice that constantly convinced him to behave against his own best interests. Each time an opportunity for fortune arose, the voice would whisper darkly in his head, causing him to lose one chance after another.\nHoping to rid himself of this curse, the knight sought out a sorcerer, but the sorcerer's price was high — to afford the huge sum, the knight had to sell his horse, his family sword, and his crested armor. But the result was worth the cost — after receiving the necklace the sorcerer created, the knight's affairs began to improve. Soon, he became the sole heir to his family's fortune, granting him a life of luxury. Enemies drove him from his family manor and out into the Stolen Lands, but even there he grew richer and more prosperous, joining a team of merry folk who ran a successful enterprise on the high road. It's amazing what one can achieve once rid of that small voice known as conscience!\nThe knight's happiness was long, but not eternal. In his old age, he found himself boarding a vessel in the hopes of finding treasure, but he instead found a trap connected to a dozen barrels of some seething alchemical substance. The ensuing explosion thundered across the area, scattering bits of the knight along with it — as well as fragments of his necklace. But now that it's been restored, the necklace is ready to bring fortune to its new owner!",

To help him, the fey enchanted his bracers with a powerful spell. After the knight eventually died, the bracers were stored as a relic in a local shrine of Erastil.\nMany years later, trouble came to the village. For reasons unknown, one of the fey had lost her mind, turning into a monster and wreaking havoc around the village. People fled, terrified — all but one calm young acolyte in the shrine. He prepared for battle, arming himself with a pitchfork and girding himself with whatever he could find — an oven shutter for a chest plate, a saucepan for a helmet, and a pair of bracers he found in the shrine to protect his hands. He didn't expect to win — he just wanted to buy enough time for the villagers to run for safety. But still, he emerged victorious.\nWhen the monster saw the bracers, she froze on the spot, moaning as if in pain. Her moan reverberated in the bracers — they trembled, droned, almost as if crying, then shattered. The monster remained frozen in that spot for three more weeks, then withdrew back to the forest. Alas, by that time the village was just a pile of rubble, but the majority of the people who lived there had survived — the bracers had aided a young brave soul in accomplishing their last heroic deed... until someone else found all the pieces and managed to restore the bracers once more.",

Bearing secret runes and forgotten symbols, it was in the possession of Dwarg's family for several generations. His grandfather, Aghar the Fierce, wore this armor while hunting a dragon — only the armor and three of his warriors returned, though carrying the dragon's head along with them. Dwarg's mother, Idra the Crusher, wore it to fight giants — and many was the time when, in contemplation, Dwarg would touch a small dent in the armor, left by a giant's sword as it decapitated his mother.\nFrom his ancestors, Dwarg inherited the armor, but not their fierce nature. The artifact resided peacefully in his tent as he earned glory of his own — not from feats on the battlefield, but with wise advice and cunning deals. He was dubbed Dwarg the Reasonable, and after yet another chieftain met his glorious death on the battlefield beside a hundred other warriors, the elders chose Dwarg to be their new leader.\nThere were many who were less than happy with Dwarg's leadership — under his rule, there were fewer glorious victories and epic battles. They took to calling him a \"sheeptain,\" claiming he'd betrayed Gorum. So it surprised no one when he was challenged by a young fighter with burning eyes known as Armag.\nFor the first time in many years, Dwarg donned his family armor, stepped into the circle, and clenched a sword in his wrinkled hands. \"He'll be their ruin,\" he thought, as Armag's blade pierced his long rage-free heart. The new chieftain threw the corpse of the old, still clad in his family armor, to the smilodons. Songs of Armag's deeds are sung to this day, while the name of his predecessor went forgotten for thousands of years. That is, until heroes and sages of a new era restored his armor.",

Each successful energy drain bestows one or more negative levels (the creature's description specifies how many). If an attack that includes an energy drain scores a critical hit, it bestows twice the listed number of negative levels. Unless otherwise specified in the creature's description, a draining creature gains 5 temporary hit points for each negative level it bestows on an opponent. These temporary hit points last for a maximum of 1 hour. Negative levels remain until 24 hours have passed or until they are removed with a spell such as restoration. If a negative level is not removed before 24 hours have passed, the affected creature must attempt a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 the draining creature's racial HD + the draining creature's Charisma modifier). On a success, the negative level goes away with no harm to the creature. On a failure, the negative level becomes permanent. A separate saving throw is required for each negative level.",

She crafted it for her husband, Jarvind, the Langebukk patriarch, before the clan forever left their homeland in the Five Kings Mountains and traveled north to establish a new trade route in the River Kingdoms. These troubled lands proved to be full of dangers, especially the territory known today as the Stolen Lands, where the dwarves encountered their sworn enemies — giants.\nA tribe of hill giants — led by a stone giant called Dagr the Earthraker — ran rampant in the area where the dwarves were building their citadel, Bronzeshield Fortress. The giants would appear out of nowhere, throw large boulders at the dwarves, and disappear before reinforcements could arrive. Infuriated, Jarvind called a hunt for Dagr — and, unfortunately for him, was successful.\nOn a frosty winter morning, a small patrol of dwarves led by Jarvind himself encountered the giants' main force. The dwarven trumpeter barely had time to reach for the horn before being crushed by a thrown boulder. Realizing his chances were slim, Jarvind charged Dagr, hoping for an honest one-on-one fight. His enchanted helm protected him, deflecting all the flying stones, but once the two adversaries clashed in close combat, Dagr grabbed Jarvind and hurled him against the nearest cliff.\nThe dwarven patriarch was dead before he hit the ground. The moment he died, his helm shattered to pieces with a thunderous clang that echoed for miles. Ordleif gathered the dwarven forces and hurried to the battlefield. In a great battle, the tribe of giants was destroyed, and the body of Jarvind was returned to the fortress for burial. The dwarves were able to find several shards of the helm, which they kept as relics, but many shards were lost. No one ever managed to collect all the shards and reforge the artifact, until now.",

It's unknown when this artifact was crafted, or by whom, but its last owner was a Taldan treasure hunter who was traveling through the Kamelands with a group of like-minded daredevils. In an ancient tomb riddled with traps, he came across a skeleton, this steel ring on its bony finger. Once he realized it was enchanted, the treasure hunter put it on his own finger without hesitation. And he didn't regret it — the artifact increased his vigor and confidence, and disabling traps seemed so easy he could do it with his eyes closed.\nThe deeper his group proceeded into the tomb, the hotter the air became, as though the adventurers were traveling through a giant oven. Ancient runes on the walls gleamed with red light, spurts of flame shot from the floor and ceiling, and fire elementals roamed the passages. More than once did his companions, tired and covered with burns, suggest turning back, taking a break, maybe resting and returning later with reinforcements. But the treasure hunter wouldn't listen — all these difficulties meant there must be real treasure hidden in the depths of the tomb, and he couldn't wait to get his hands on it.\nWhen the group entered the burial chamber, the door behind them shut tight, and pillars of flame began dancing around the hall. One of his companions pointed out a crimson crystal, welded into the lid of the sarcophagus — that must be the source of the energy fueling all the traps in the dungeon, he figured. It was possible to approach the sarcophagus carefully, to avoid the roaring flames and carefully remove the crystal. But our treasure hunter's plan was much more direct — without thinking twice, he picked up a stone and hurled it into the crystal.\nThe explosion was so strong it must have been heard in Numeria. Where the tomb once was had become a deep crater. The adventurers had instantly turned to ashes, and the shards of the ring were scattered all over the Kamelands. It would be a thousand years before a new daredevil would find them, restore the artifact, and put their luck to the test.",

For all weapons a natural 20 is always a threat, but for some weapons threat range is greater than just 20, for example, 18-20 (you still need to make a successful hit to score a threat). A weapon's threat range is specified in its description. To turn a threat into a proper critical hit, you immediately make an attempt to \"confirm\" it — another attack roll with all the same modifiers as the attack roll you just made. If the confirmation roll results in a hit against the target's {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Class}AC{/g}, your original hit becomes a critical hit. The confirmation roll just needs to hit to give you a crit, it doesn't need to fit the threat range again.\nA critical hit means that you roll your damage more than once, with all your usual {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonuses{/g}, and add the rolls together. Most weapons let you roll your damage twice, but some weapons, for example bows, axes and most {g|Encyclopedia:Light_Weapon}two-handed{/g} weapons, deal better than double damage on a critical hit. It is specified in their description.\n<b>Precision damage</b>\nPrecision damage (such as from a rogue's sneak attack) and additional damage dice from weapon {g|Encyclopedia:Special_Abilities}special abilities{/g} (such as flaming) are not multiplied when you score a critical hit.\n<b>{g|Encyclopedia:Spell}Spells{/g} and Critical Hits</b>\nA spell that requires an attack roll (as a {g|Encyclopedia:TouchAttack}touch attack{/g} in most cases) can score a critical hit and deal double damage.
