    "81e1fa41-e24c-4f1b-80a8-bf171034bfaf": "A gowrow, an enormous reptilian beast, had once terrorized the riverside settlements of Sarkoris with its devastating attacks. The locals called it Chillroar for its thick ice-covered hide which no axe or lance could possibly penetrate, and its feral growl could blow a knight off the horse's back. Old, leery, and cunning, the beast satisfied its thirst for blood by destroying anyone who tried to kill it, and there was never a shortage of such brave yet foolish souls. While the small tribe of mountain giants worshiped the ancient gowrow, the Sarkorian tribes considered Chillroar a grim threat, encouraging the best of their warriors to try and defeat it in a feat of strength which would be remembered for ages to come. Despite those heroes' valiant efforts, Chillroar managed to outlive its enemies: Sarkoris fell to the demonic onslaught. The creature's triumph did not last long, however. The opening of the Worldwound had changed the local landscape forever, draining many rivers dry and wrecking the gowrow's lair. Finally, demons tracked down the legendary beast and brutally slayed it.",
