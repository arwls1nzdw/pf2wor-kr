You experience the events as if you lived through them:\n{br}\"The crooked, rundown house creaks when I enter, as if about to collapse on my head at any moment. I lower my hood and bow respectfully to the mistress of this... abode.\n'Ah, another highborn has arrived. What are you, sick?'\nThe old woman giggles shrilly. Her voice is repulsive and her appearance worse still. She could easily have been mistaken for a corpse wrapped in a pile of rags. Her face is unpleasant and her skin is as creased as a bat wing, widely plagued with warts.\n'I have come for healing, mother. Please be so kind as to help me.'\nThe druid chuckles nastily again — from the look of it, it's some kind of tic. She enjoys the feeling of power over me.\n'I might treat you, girl. But not for free. No, no, not for free. Do you know what price I ask?'\nI nod silently and take the gift out of my bag: meat, in slimy, bloody chunks. It is amazing how such an insignificant and common thing can be valued so highly. The old woman grabs the meat greedily, bringing it to her face, making sure it smells right.\n'You must be in real trouble, since you have come to me with fresh meat.'\nThe hag draws even closer, radiating the sickly sweet, unpleasant smell of old age. I impatiently wait for her to finish examining me.\n'You smell bad, foul... You have committed a great crime against nature, and for that you suffer,' the old woman's shrill voice becomes accusatory and imperious. 'You think you can ransom yourself from your doom? Oh no, you will suffer, you will rot, and you will bleed for your sin...'\nMy patience runs out. With a quick gesture, I unchain my anger, and the druid tumbles away, crashing into a pyramid of cauldrons, which cascade down in all directions into a crumbled mess of broken shards.\n'I grow sick of your antics. You understand who I am — fine. I know you too: you are the oldest and strongest of the servants of Mother Vulture. You know how to heal what others cannot — and you will help me, otherwise...'\nThe old woman cries out, frightened; she covers her face with her hands, her lips trembling. I wait apathetically for her to calm down. Realizing how close to death she truly is, the old woman hurries to comply. Her movements display efficiency that only fear and desperation can provide. Herbs, both commonly known and arcane, fly into the cauldron above the druid's fire. They are followed by the meat I brought, magic powders, and potions from small, cobweb-covered bottles. When the decoction boils, the old woman cautiously approaches me and grips my cloak with her knotted fingers.\nHer demand is brisk: 'Give it to me, girl. I need it.'\nI part with the cloak indifferently, and into the cauldron it goes. The old woman whispers incantations, seeming to take forever. Finally, she fishes into the cauldron with her walking stick and pulls out a wet, smelly cloak, handing it to me.\n'Put it on your shoulders. This cloak, like a leech, sucks any disease from the soul, heals any corruption. The world has never seen a relic greater than this...'\nThe cloak smells disgusting, but I don't care. I slip it over my shoulders, feeling the magic lurking within it touch my dual soul. And then... flame engulfs me! The fabric clings to my body, and the burning pain it brings is unexpectedly strong. She dared to hurt me? Me?\nI rip off the damned rag, as the old woman's shrill laughter rattles in my ears.\n'You tricked me!'\nThe old woman seems ready to dance.\n'Tricked you? Not a word I said was untrue! There isn't a relic in the world better at healing than the one I gave you! But neither magic nor gods will help you with your misfortune! You are doomed! And you shall bear your wound till your last day.'\nI clench my fist, snuffing out the old woman's life. But her body writhes and warps unnaturally — four black wings grow out of her hunched back, her wrinkled neck lengthens and splits in two, her gnarled head becomes a matching — or rather slightly mismatching — pair, and the toothless mouths on them both open wide to exude a putrid stench.\n'Mother Vulture. Do you honor me with a personal visit?'\nThe monster, with both heads lowered, looks at me intently. Its eyes sparkle with the same slyness as the last wearer of the hag's skin.\n'Begone, Architect! Neither I nor anyone else can help you. The things you've done to yourself with your own hands can never be healed. You will endure pain for the rest of your days, and after that you will perish like every other living creature, from the greatest of heroes to the meekest of swamp gnats. Such is the way of things; 'tis proper. Everything that lives, dies, so that new life can be born out of it.'\nWithout wasting any words, I retreat to the door. Even the mighty usher of Pharasma herself couldn't help me, but that doesn't mean anything. 'Impossible to heal,' she said? I've done the impossible before... and I'll find a way now.\"",
