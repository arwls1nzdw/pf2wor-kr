You witness the events as if you lived through them:\n{br}\"The call of a battle horn cuts through the silence of the night. Stern Brother and I leap over the palisade, knock the sleepy sentry to the ground, and race down the street — to the chief's house! Our comrades follow us in complete silence, only the long, wistful howl of the Stern Brother informs the village that the evil hour has come.\nWe barge into the chief's house, pressing frightened people against the walls with harsh looks. Three people are crouched in the back of the room, a man and a woman covering a lanky, pale lad with their bodies.\nStern Brother beside me growls — dirrrt. People fear him — a huge, coal-black wolf can terrify with a mere glance.\nI step forward.\n'My name is Setrei Devimai, and I am a witch hunter. Neither I, this wolf, nor my people will harm any good Sarkorians. We have come only for the evildoers who have broken the law and are harboring filth.'\nStern Brother inches forward, but I place my gauntlet on his scruff — it's too early, this can still be bloodless. He obeys, but he and I are not master and servant; we are brothers.\nThe man — the chief — shouts fiercely, 'We didn't hurt anyone!'\n'What do you consider evil, if you call yourself innocent? You have transgressed against your ancestors and gods, you have bred the filth of arcane power into your blood, you have intermarried your brothers and sisters in order to strengthen it. And what have you born? A freak!'\nThe man and the woman look at each other, ashamed — I caught them, a brother and sister, whom dark, unnatural forces have given the curse of sorcery.\nThe woman cries out desperately, 'Have mercy on him! He is harmless! Look, he's not right in the head! He has the mind of a baby!'\nThe pale boy clings to his mother and father — while he is big and strong, his blue eyes are naive and frightened. A child, weak in the head, a danger to no one... a clever trick.\n'Seven dead fishermen down by the river. Killed and disemboweled by magic. Good people who did no harm to anyone. Were you just curious to see what they were made of?'\nThe blue eyes stare at me blankly.\n'Children in the meadow by the Bee Grove. You just wanted to play with them, perhaps? And you didn't like losing, right?'\nHis eyes glaze over, like two blue buttons on his white face.\n'And the girl? You liked her... but you didn't like that she resisted?'\nHis full lips stretch into a smile. His expression grows serious, cruel, mocking.\n'Yes.'\nHe dispenses with his mask. Underneath, he's a clever, cunning, guileful monster who knows no compassion, knows no good. Spoiled with powers that a mortal should not have. Not a man — a witch. The lad puts his hands on his father's and mother's shoulders and takes their vitality, sucking the life out of them like a mosquito. And then he stretches his hand toward me and sends death in my direction.\nStunned and dizzy, I fall to my knees, bleeding from my ears, eyes, and nose. The gauntlets on my hands explode, cutting my fingers and palms with steel splinters. The brat raises his other hand — this is it, the end.\nThen, black lightning flashes in front of my eyes. Stern Brother leaps forward, shielding me with his body. A monstrous blow throws his furry body right into and on top of me. I find myself on the floor, his eyes in front of mine, and I realize that my brother is... dead.\nI howl. Beside myself, I throw back the body of Stern Brother, snatch up a dagger with my bloody, mangled hand, and throw it at the witch. The blade pierces his blue eye... but doesn't kill him. The boy whimpers, crawling on the floor, fumbling blindly with his hands, calling for his mother...\n'Too late! You've already killed her!'\nI rush over to him, pull the dagger out of the wound, and swing... You! You killed the one closest to me! And I'll kill you for that!\nI pull the swing back and toss the dagger down — no, I won't. The witch is insane with pain he's never felt before. He is helpless and frightened, not a threat. So he will go to Threshold, as the law dictates. I am Setrei Devimai, servant of Sarkoris. No matter how much it hurts, I won't become like... that thing. I won't kill just because I want to. As they tie up the witch, and I hug my Stern Brother for the last time.\nThis tragedy is why people should not wield arcane magic. It is no gift from spirits, not from ancestors, and not from gods. It is a curse, coming of its own accord, tempered by no watchful eye keeping track of your deeds and no voice warning of what is right and what is vile. Instead, such magic gives a sense of impunity and pride, fostering contempt for others. It debases people into monsters, for whom all others are ants.\nMy chest feels cold and nasty, plagued by a strange feeling that won't leave me. It's as if an evil even more vile and dark is lurking somewhere outside this damned house. Something I'm going to meet... and that will change everything.\nThe soldier touches my shoulder gently.\n'Sir Devimai. A messenger delivered a message from Threshold. We need to check a suspicious house. It is nearby, standing alone. According to the report, a single woman lives there.'\nThe feeling inside me grows even more rotten, but I nod silently. Duty is duty.\"",

Hecatrix was the queen of courtesans and the most beautiful of women. Her heart-winning power was so great that even kings and queens could not harm her — the cruelest assassins would prostrate themselves at her feet like loyal hounds. Impressed by her beauty and sensuality, the goddesses Shelyn and Calistria decided she should be their priestess and quarreled ferociously over her. Shrewd Hecatrix never was a chooser. She always wanted it all, so she praised each goddess in secret when her rival was not present. She was collecting all the blessings of Shelyn and Calistria in a beautiful gem until one night the truth about her deception was revealed. Both goddesses were enraged by her betrayal, and while the kind Shelyn forgave the traitress, Calistria decided to destroy her. In the course of an unbridled wine-fueled nocturnal orgy of debauchery, the queen of the courtesans was torn to pieces by a crowd driven mad with lust.\nNo one paid any heed to Hecatrix for two hundred years until one day the sin-soaked soul of a succubus with a magnificent scarlet gemstone on her bosom awakened in the Abyss. The gemstone was called the Attractive Impulse. The gem combined the passion and lust of the queen of courtesans with the blessings of two goddesses, which together forged a dangerous and alluring relic.",
