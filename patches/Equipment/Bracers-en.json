    "b43c292c-fddd-4e72-b7be-4feb4be68247": "\"Maestro Janush,\nThe problem is finally solved, and we have an incident report on all damages sustained by our organization. The company of technomancers and their robotic escort, deployed at your command, have finally eliminated this nuisance.\nI regret to inform you that very few of our men have survived the assault. The Myrmidon and lower class robots have been reduced to parts, and only one of our two precious Annihilators is still in service, although heavily damaged and beyond our capabilities to repair.\nAt least, the case of this \"Disaster on Numeria\" is finally closed for good, and the complete reports will be sent to you as soon as possible. In the meantime I can shed some light on the main lines of inquiry at play here.\nFor the moment, this seems to have been the work of a small group of powerful and well organized individuals, referred to as the Five Disasters until further information is recovered:\n-One android, unregistered, with four arms and heavily customized cyberware, which is what allowed it to cause such heavy damage with crippling and often fatal explosives. We have not been able to repair it and put it to use, all that we have able to extract is a chunk of strange nanite cloud that settles into a tangible form, and some largely corrupted data. For now, our restoration efforts have only succeeded in extracting a self-identification of \"Gears\" and several recurring names — \"Eloniel\", \"Sayeh\", \"Shindra\", \"Elfrieda\", \"Maks\", \"Byllee\" and \"Sandalee\". We are hopeful that the names of the Disasters are among them, as this is the only promising starting point for our investigation.\n-What seemed to be a female angel (possessing wings and the powerful holy aura), who greatly delayed the execution of the Disasters through her sustained curative powers. With her support the Disasters seemed to heal faster than they could be damaged, and with each heal one of our men seemed to suffer a backlash and spontaneously combust.\n-A female devil or similar beast (horns, tail, small pointed fangs, extremely nimble). She was the last to fall, even though her damage output did not seem to match that of her peers. She seemed untouchable, until the Annihilator obliterated the general region she was last seen in.\n-A human female, with very strange powers. Attacking our troops with the combination of a bow and mysterious singing, she seems to have caused sporadic mutations and a burst of aggression in her allies during battle. No traces of her or mutations remained afterwards, though we are still investigating.\n-The last case is quite unusual, and resists easy classification. An elven male or possibly half-elf in appearance, he threw himself into the fray drooling with rage and unleashing a storm of steel and lead with a blade and a handgun. Between two assaults, the android scratched him and he changed into a massive six-armed creature made of water – wreaking havoc among our ranks with claws, fangs and weapons. There is clearly still much to investigate.\nThe aforementioned Disasters seem to be behind the deaths of our agents that lead to the end of our activity at the Scar of the Spider, on the Felldale side, forcing us to return to our headquarters at Starfall.\nTheir true intentions and the motivation behind their hostilities are still unknown, our teams have always been assaulted without a word.\nDespite this hard blow you will be happy to know that our activity in Numeria should have been resumed by the time this message will have reached you.\nKalannah\nPS. I attach to this letter a box containing the remains of the android, the nanites take form and fuse, but seem practically inert and unresponsive to our experts and analysis machines. Maybe you can find some use for them.\"",
