You witness the events as if you lived through them yourself:\n{br}\"'...Together, we can put an end to their tyrannical rule over us. Let them accept us and see us as people — or if they try to subdue us by force, as before, let them prepare to feel our pushback! We will force them to overturn their meaningless, superstitious ban on arcane magic. We will make them see us as people, not as 'evil witches.' We will destroy the cursed prison of Threshold and set free the innocents within, doomed to wretched and unjust imprisonment. We will save Sarkoris, but only together. I therefore urge anyone and everyone for whom freedom is worth rebelling and fighting for, to join our alliance.\nYour brother in magic, Opon.'\nAnother letter is ready. I seal it with wax and leave the imprint of my signet ring in the soft scarlet substance. There's no need to hide when reaching out to comrades. My fingers cramp up, tired of holding the quill that has rewritten, over and over, the same letter for what seems like the hundredth time this morning. Clearly, I need a break.\nI twist the ring of summoning on my finger and a proud bird appears before me, its feathers gleaming with gold. The summoned bird waits patiently while I tie the letter to its leg, then it flies out the window. Yet another messenger dispatched. This bird, like so many others, will fly over Sarkoris to find a fellow practitioner of the arcane arts. Together, we can bring about a revolution. We simply must unite our efforts. It is time to change our country, to overthrow the dictatorship oppressing us, to cast off the terror that has enveloped us, to stop the ruthless hunting of innocents.\nI leave my study and look into the guest room — the poor souls are sound asleep. A boy and a girl — both spellcasters, outlaws, and criminals like me. They were on the run for three months until I offered them shelter here. They'll be hungry when they wake up — I need to get some bread and dried fish.\nAnd outside, spring awaits! The smell of flowers creeps in to tickle my nose playfully, the sun smiles, eager to embrace me with its light, and the soft wind slyly kisses my cheeks, whispering in my ear, 'It's going to be all right!' Winter is behind us, and the glorious, well-fed, and hard-working city of Iz welcomes spring! I love my city, I love the people who live here. Nowhere else have I met such selfless and heartfelt people, capable of coming to their neighbor's aid, of welcoming a stranger into their home and seating him by the hearth. They are the best people in the whole world... until they get scared.\nOh, my good Iz, how can you be so indifferent to the injustice reigning in Sarkoris?\nI'm getting emotional. Truly, my heart is soft and urges of rebellion only uneasily find a home within me. I see a girl sitting in an alleyway, shedding tears over her broken doll. I pass her by and glance back cautiously — she's sitting alone, no one else is around. The mark of a cartwheel scars her doll's mangled torso. It is beyond repair... I approach the girl carefully, take a seat, and smile at the child. She looks at me warily, but without fear. I look around again — still, no one is nearby. Ah, all right! I turn the signet on my finger, and the air above the sidewalk twists into the form of a tiny man made of whirlwinds. The garbage around him flies up in the air as the magic man starts moving, bowing dramatically, then grabs the doll and dances with it. The tears on the girl's cheeks dry instantly, replaced with laughter and joy. Then I hurry away. The tiny elemental will give the little one another minute or two of happiness, and then it will fade away. My act of kindness was a stupid risk, but... that's what we're fighting for. For freedom, for children's laughter, for the feeling in our hearts that we've done everything right and in good conscience.\n{br}Rumble and noise. The voices are loud and unkind, so scary that my dream dissolves instantly, scurrying away like a frightened animal. Stomping on the stairs, fists drumming on the door — I know these sounds. It's the sound of a night arrest, the sound of people entering a home to drag away an innocent into the night. I run to the next room, growling, 'We're leaving!' But it's too late — the door swings open and behind it there is a man with a huge black wolf at his feet. Setrei Devimai, suppressor of the voices of freedom. The scum who suffocated his own conscience while it was still in the crib. The lad I took in throws himself at the brute, yelling, 'Run, Sir Opon!' A brave kid, indeed... but where can I run? Torches and spears flank the windows, while the soultaker and his henchmen bar the door. They stand there, swords drawn, demanding my surrender. The boy is already crumpled up and lying in the corner, bent in half from the blow of that scoundrel Setrei's fist. The wolf snarls, foam dripping from its maw...\nSurrender? Fat chance, you scum! I'll never make it out of here alive, but they'll not soon forget Sir Opon! I turn the signet on my finger, ready to set a dozen soul eaters loose. Yet, I pause as a familiar face flashes in the doorway — a crying girl, next to a pale man and woman — surely her parents. They brought her to identify me, to ensure that I wouldn't escape the hunt through some trickery! What scoundrels! I will...\nI will... what? What can I do? My beloved Iz stretches out before my eyes. How many houses are there around me? How many families? How many people are sleeping in their beds right now? They are kind people, albeit unfairly cruel to us. Are you willing to bring monsters down on your city, Opon? On your neighbors? Would you watch them die screaming and choking, fighting for breath? Would you watch your monsters rip the very souls out of their children? Do you have so much hate in you, Opon? Are you really... a malevolent witch, a monster, as they claim?\nI am shaken, as if someone has walked on my grave. I stand there, shivering, afraid of myself, as time slips away. The black wolf leaps forward, his teeth sinking into my hand. My fingers, bitten off entirely, disappear down his throat, while the ring of summoning groans, crushed by horrific jaws.\nI throw myself onto the floor and roll around, screaming and thrashing about — as if it helps. The brutes drag me to my feet and punch me in the stomach. My hand hurts as if the damn wolf were still chewing on it. For all my hopes and good intentions, this is my fate...\"",

An apprentice of Zacharius — a great hero of the crusade — Stevanius deserted on the eve of the battle for the Lost Chapel and dedicated himself to the forbidden art of necromancy. When the inquisitors caught up with him, Stevanius made an outrageous claim that his master, the valiant Zacharius, had also been practicing necromancy, using its dark secrets against the demons. Shortly afterward, Stevanius managed to escape, killing the warriors sent to arrest him. According to his journal, his next undertaking was a ritual that was supposed to transform him into a lich, an immortal master over the undead. The details of the ritual are now lost, but all the research into undeath points out that such potent magic cannot possibly exist. The tragic death of Stevanius the Rotten, who failed to achieve immortality and ended up a mindless undead, serves as yet further proof of this.",
