Most mithral armors are one category lighter than normal for purposes of movement and other limitations. Heavy armors are treated as medium, and medium armors are treated as light, but light armors are still treated as light. This decrease does not apply to proficiency in wearing the armor. {g|Encyclopedia:Spell_Fail_Chance}Spell failure chances{/g} for armors and shields made from mithral are decreased by 10%, maximum {g|Encyclopedia:Dexterity}Dexterity{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonuses{/g} are increased by 2, and {g|Encyclopedia:Armor_Check_Penalty}armor check penalties{/g} are decreased by 3 (to a minimum of 0).
