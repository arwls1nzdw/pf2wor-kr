I walk on the cobblestones of my city, wrapped in a white cloak, hiding my face under my helmet. I try to be inconspicuous, because I'm modest.\nWho will try to stop me today? I notice two men in the alley — not hunters coming for my head, just two ordinary people who didn't have time to hide. I cut their lives short, quickly and boringly, hanging their bodies upside down in the sky, using invisible harnesses. I don't touch the flesh — although we, vrolikais like to treat ourselves to our fallen enemies, I'm not killing for hunger right now.\nI hide in the shadows, listening. Someone is following me stealthily — I hear his footsteps. Walking... so vulgar. I spread my wings and soar silently into the air, taking cover behind a stone statue and waiting.\nHe reaches the place where my trail ends and looks around stupidly. Dumb, heavy, strong, and covered in layers of sturdy armor — I attack from the sky, plunging all four of my blades into the slits of his armor. The hunter dies quickly, offering me no pleasure at all. I hang him in the sky.\nThe massacre is in full swing, and no worthy opponents have tried to stop me yet. Why?\nCurious, I walk out openly into the light, haughtily inviting my enemies to take part in the fun. Three winged shadows attack in sync, circling as if in a dance, wriggling around me like a twisting whip of a balor. I too twist and turn, slashing at their sweet, fragile bodies with my daggers as they tear at me. A pleasure, but short-lived. Their bodies painted with the wounds I inflicted, the trio disappears into portals. I watch them leave — until we meet again, sinners. You are inimitable as usual. One day I will hang you upside down in the sky, but obviously not today. I'm still not satisfied.\nA couple of guests from another plane are coming my way, eager to test their strength against me. I shower them with contempt and a stream of spells that make them curl up into balls and weep. I could kill them in a heartbeat, but... I can't hang them from the sky — Our Lady in Shadow doesn't like her rules broken. Guests of Alushinyrra have to be very guilty to deserve death.\nFinally! Heavy footsteps make the sidewalk shake! This is no huntsman, it's an executioner! Finally, decent prey!\nA huge balor stands in my way. He has a sword in his right hand and a sword in his left. A fire whip won't help him in this fight, so he's armed himself with a more suitable weapon.\nI soar through the air, twisting, and evading his crushing blows — he, though massive, is fast. Such a pleasure! Leaving a thousand cuts, I make his large body weep a shower of dark blood. Pretending to hesitate, I let both his swords pierce my back. The tips come out of my chest, while all four of my daggers cut through his muscular neck, severing his horned head.\nWith that, it's over. I suspend his giant carcass high in the sky, above everyone else, for all the city to see. Let them fear my harvest.\nI walk out into the lit street, and I am stunned by the thunder of applause. The entirety of Alushinyrra thanks me for the magnificent performance, welcomes me, praises me. The bodies in the sky rotate slowly, strung up by their legs — they are my trophies. Wrapped in my white cloak, I lower my helmet-clad face. That's why they call me the Shy Lily.\nI head toward the Harem of Ardent Dreams, the hilts of balor's swords still sticking out of my back, and swaying majestically — an exquisite and refined decoration. But I'm not completely satisfied... The last enemy was good, but he alone is not enough for me. My spirit is not yet at peace.\nI enter Shamira's abode, and feel the air trembling with fear, ready to become a bloody mist at any moment. The Ardent Dream looks angrily at... a mortal standing before her shining throne? Ah, it's the new toy of Our Lady in Shadow, a mortal from the Material Plane, a witch named... Vorlesh? The woman keeps calm and looks indifferently past Alushinyrra's viceroy, as if she were nothing more than a lousy insect. What is this, a sign of self-righteous audacity or strength?\nShamira is furious, the whole city knows it. The mortal wench captured Nocticula's attention, stirred her interest. The Ardent Dream wants her dead... this Vorlesh. And I want to soothe the longing in my chest. I walk forward, listening to the conversation — heated insults against icy-cold, contemptuous indifference. Vorlesh isn't looking for a fight with Shamira, but she's not afraid of her either — and could there be a greater insult?\nThe viceroy glances around the gathering, looking for the executioner — oh, she would love to tear this mortal apart herself, but she is the one whose disobedience Our Lady in Shadow will not forgive. That's why Shamira is looking for someone to kill Vorlesh for her. I meet her gaze and nod meekly. Shamira smiles.\n'Am I correct in assuming there is no reverence in your heart for magnificent Shamira? Is that why you don't bow down to her?' — I whisper.\n'Yes, winged one. You got that right.'\nHer voice is splendid — indifferent and impassive, like a wave of Ishiar rolling against a rock.\n'Then I will punish you, mortal. You have no respect for power, relying on Nocticula's patronage. Such disobedience is followed by punishment, and even Our Lady in Shadow will acquit me.'\nMy heart sings. A proper murder! My spirit will be at peace today! The woman nods dryly. The song in my chest gets louder and happier.\n'Look out, Shy Lily! This 'mortal' will skin you, claw off your helmet along with your face, and then make you throw yourself on your own daggers!'\nI disdainfully ignore the shouts and happy laughter from the crowd. Irmangaleth, the bloody buffoon, is clowning around as usual. If he understood anything at all...\"",

As beautiful as she was depraved, this priestess was born into the family of the noble magician Conthyr. After he witnessed his daughter's disturbing inclinations, he sought to root out the little girl's taint through purifying rituals, but all of his efforts were for naught — Zaoris's heart was evil through and through. She hated her father and swore herself to the demon lord Nocticula, who gifted her with a magic pin that could seduce and enslave people's minds after it tasted a single drop of their blood. Zaoris used it to dominate Conthyr's will, then used his magic to bring death and destruction to the townsfolk of Katapesh. Her army grew day after day, as she used the pin to enthrall new servants.\nZaoris reveled in her cruelty, and her terror lasted for many years. She smiled as she handed weapons to children and promised them freedom if they spilled the blood of their fathers. She made sacrifices to Nocticula and forced her father Conthyr to incinerate entire settlements. And yet the magician managed to retain a few shreds of free will. Not wishing to serve evil, Conthyr tricked his daughter into exploring an abandoned temple of Calistria, the goddess of lust and vengeance. Tempted by treasure and unaware that the temple was cursed, Zaoris agreed, and so she and her father set out to meet their doom — together.\nThe temple's most precious treasure was the Book of Redemption. Clad in a cover of gold and jewels, it was magnificent. Zaoris thought the book contained destructive spells, but realized her mistake the moment she opened it. All the braziers in the abandoned temple flared up, and crimson words seeped onto an empty page — the Book of Redemption chronicled Zaoris's guilty acts in blood. The priestess cried out in unbearable pain as the curse struck her — any murderer who entered the temple fell prey to their own crimes, endlessly experiencing the agony felt by each of their victims. The temple doors slammed shut and the magic of the pin faded. Zaoris and Conthyr found themselves trapped at the altar.\nDelirious with pain, the priestess stabbed her father to death with the disempowered pin and then pierced her own heart, but her spirit found no rest in the afterlife. The agonized face of the priestess kept haunting the subsequent owners of the pin for years, and even after the cursed item found its way back to Nocticula, Zaoris the Crimson refused to vanish for good.",

Laffar chose only impossible goals and Norgorber helped him. When he finally came to believe that no treasures were worthy of him, Laffar decided to steal from his god. He did this not out of greed, but to prove his skill, and thus luck was on his side.\nHaving snatched a relic called the Stone of Ghostly Pathways from the abode of Norgorber, Laffar absconded, with cloaks rustling and daggers flashing behind his back. No matter how far north the crafty thief went, his pursuers kept on his tail, and soon Laffar realized that he was doomed. He threw the stolen stone into a pile of rubble and accepted his fate with a happy smile. Norgorber's servants never found the stolen relic, which meant that Laffar's trick ultimately met with success.\nAccording to legend, after many centuries, the Stone of Ghostly Pathways fell into the hands of a shaman who lived near there. His guiding spiritual instinct led him to acquire this unremarkable stone.
