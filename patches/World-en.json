They were certain that the war would soon be over, so they didn't go too far and found their refuge here, in Kenabres. They used what little savings they had to build a tavern where any crusader could get a bowl of soup and a good night's rest in exchange for some money and news about their recent victories.\nThe city looked completely different back then. It was a triumphant city, full of hope, inspiring songs, and brave paladins in shining armor. We praised our lady Pulura openly and hoped that the lands of our ancestors would be ours again in no time.\nThings have changed since then, though. Our parents have left to the goddess' halls. Drezen is long gone. The Worldwound grows deeper every day, and the crusaders seem to take more interest in fighting each other and us townsfolk than in eradicating demons. Hulrun has gone mad and now puts all his inquisitive zeal into burning witches. Today Kenabres is a city of fear and suspicion. We even had to hide our altar of the Shimmering Maiden in the basement so they wouldn't accuse us of demon worship.\nQueen Galfrey has recently appointed Hulrun the prelate of Kenabres. Now nothing will stop this murderer from taking complete control of the city into his hands and serving his so-called justice on everyone. His previous acts of violence were just the beginning of a full-scale massacre. We have to flee, run like our parents did — this time not from demons, but from the crusaders. Soon we will sell our tavern and leave — anywhere away from the agony of this endless war. May Pulura protect this city from whatever comes next.\n10th of Lamashan, 4682\nSwargell family, of the Devimai clan\"",

Recently we raided the Tower of Estrod in Kenabres, and with Norgorber's blessing we took quite a haul. We hid in a reliable place with bad reputation, somewhere the law would never think of going. We were celebrating our success when Quickrick appeared and choked two of our friends to death. We knew things were bad, because Quickrick had already been dead for about four hours. The old man was a drunk, and his heart had failed on the steep mountain roads. Terrified, we chopped Quickrick into pieces. But a few hours later he came for us again, and he brought with him the two he killed earlier. That's when the real nightmare began, something so bad the mind can't take it. Corpses came back to life, howling, screaming in pain and rage, and killing. The way they killed...\nEven now we're sitting in a cave, keeping a wall of fire burning with oil sanctified by the priests of Iomedae. It's the only thing separating us from the mob of walking corpses we once called friends. Praise Norgorber, we took an oil vessel with us from the Tower of Estrod. It won't last another day, if the heat doesn't kill us quicker.\nLooks like the Nasty Waifs are done. So, here's our offer. If you can get to Dry River Canyon and get us out of here, we'll honestly return all the loot, show you all our hiding spots, empty our pockets, confess to everything, and accept any punishment except for the gallows. If you want, we'll even sign up to be crusaders. We'd rather die in the mouth of a demon than suffer here forever with our friends.\nI know my comrades well, and the man who planted this letter for you will have long ago escaped to the south. I beg you — here's the exact location of the place where the Nasty Waifs are making their final stand.\nIf you have a drop of mercy in you, save our souls.\nHarkel, honest thief and chosen chief of the Nasty Waifs\"",
