The dwarf leading the party approaches the edge of the cliff, and points down to the ruins of a tower built upon the rock three hundred feet below. Its very existence raises a number of questions: who would dare to build a tower here, so close to the demons? Why would they erect it here, at the bottom of a canyon? An expert analysis of the tower structure provides the answers. Numerous features in its design indicate that the building dates back to the golden age of the {g|Azlant}Azlanti Empire{/g}. It is several times older than the Worldwound, and was originally constructed on top of a mountain, before the cataclysm changed everything. The tectonic plates shifted, causing the tower to sink to the bottom of a newly formed canyon, and the mountains rose up around it like the jaws of a predator, ready to snap shut and bury it beneath the rock forever.",

However, in order to reach it, the Commander must find a way past the river of fire, in which tiny islets of porous stone are just barely visible.
