Hecatrix was the queen of courtesans and the most beautiful of women. Her heart-winning power was so great that even kings and queens could not harm her — the cruelest assassins would prostrate themselves at her feet like loyal hounds. Impressed by her beauty and sensuality, the goddesses Shelyn and Calistria decided she should be their priestess and quarreled ferociously over her. Shrewd Hecatrix never was a chooser. She always wanted it all, so she praised each goddess in secret when her rival was not present. She was collecting all the blessings of Shelyn and Calistria in a beautiful gem until one night the truth about her deception was revealed. Both goddesses were enraged by her betrayal, and while the kind Shelyn forgave the traitress, Calistria decided to destroy her. In the course of an unbridled wine-fueled nocturnal orgy of debauchery, the queen of the courtesans was torn to pieces by a crowd driven mad with lust.\nNo one paid any heed to Hecatrix for two hundred years until one day the sin-soaked soul of a succubus with a magnificent scarlet gemstone on her bosom awakened in the Abyss. The gemstone was called the Attractive Impulse. The gem combined the passion and lust of the queen of courtesans with the blessings of two goddesses, which together forged a dangerous and alluring relic.",

Throughout the ages, the first retriever fell under the ownership of different demon masters but was an impeccable servant to all. A mortal heretic and twice renegade finally put a halt to the first retriever's murderous servitude. The Templar of the Ivory Labyrinth, whose name is unknown, repented of his deeds and left the cult. The first retriever was sent forth on his trail but never returned — both retriever and prey fell in the fight. Later, the demons discovered the retriever's remains and cobweb and turned them into an altar. The retriever's ravenous hunger seeped into the altar.

    "b90977bc-3234-4352-a855-2e3a70643730": "Captain Kerz became famous among the pirates of the Abyss after he slew the legendary monster called the Colorless One. This monstrosity spawned from the calcified remains of demon lord Colyphyr. His body became an island, his blood became crystals, and the disgusting ichor that seeped through the isle's crags gave life to a monster — a crystalline ooze of mythic proportions. Silent and unseen, the creature slid through the waves of Ishiar, waiting for airships. When spotting prey, its tendrils shot out of the water like monumental pillars and shattered decks into splinters. The translucent slime engulfed the sailors' bodies and slowly dissolved them. The Colorless One also attacked border settlements, devouring everything in its path and leaving nothing except bloody ooze and acid-scarred buildings behind. No weapon or spell could overcome this beast.\nFor Captain Kerz, hunting the Colorless One was a challenge. Stalking the beast in Ishiar for three years, he figured out that the Colorless One regularly returned to Colyphyr to recover its strength and drink from springs tainted with the ichor of its progenitor. Kerz set up an ambush next to one of such riverlets, catching the Colorless One unaware. He gave a signal, and the fire spells ignited, encircling the mound of predatory slime with an incendiary wall. The creature boiled, foamed, and raged in the trap but could not break out. The thing was dying… but too slowly. The fire magic ran its course, and the incendiary wall began to fade. The Colorless One attacked, grabbing the pirates, and devouring them one after the other.\nThe outcome of the fight hung by a thread when a flaming arrow streaked through the sky — it was \"Rabid Bitch,\" Captain Kerz's airship, and he was piloting her straight into the Colorless One. Her sails and her hull were ablaze, lit by the pirate's steady hand. The captain himself stood at the helm. The burning vessel struck the pile of slime like a battering ram, and an explosion shook the island. The monster's chunks were tossed hundreds of feet away, where they writhed helplessly and dried into crystalline powder.\nWafts of poisonous smoke rose to the sky and a toxic cloud swelled over the site of the explosion. And it was from that cloud that Captain Kerz triumphantly emerged — much to the joy of his remaining crew — covered in burns and sores left by the caustic slime, but alive and victorious. The tale of his hunt became a legend among the denizens of the Abyss, and the Colorless One became a small pile of crystallic refuse. However, it still retained a modicum of its terrifying power.",

It was he who captured the mysterious Collector that had been preying upon Alushinyrra's nobility and it was he who returned Ar-Mikheth's stolen golden carbuncle, but his most famous investigation is by far the case of the burning gladiators.\nOne day, a bunch of slaves stepped onto the sand of the Battlebliss arena unbidden. They were cloaked in flames but did not scream, silently carrying the bodies of their slain jailers on the tips of their spears. Having formed a column before the demons, awestruck at the sight, they spoke in a single voice: \"I have been taken from, so now I take.\" A moment later, they vanished in a conflagration that incinerated most of the spectators, leaving only charred words on the ashen floor of the arena: \"For pain and fire.\"\nThis incident was just the beginning. The killings in the arena continued, with gladiators seemingly losing their minds and attacking the guards, catching fire, and burning to ash alongside their tormentors. All that remained were the cryptic words: \"For pain and fire.\" Shamira the Ardent Dream commanded Djail to solve the mystery of these unusual deaths.\nDjail took a cup of blood and on every wall of the arena, wrote the following: \"I have taken from you. And I will take again.\" Having issued this challenge to the unknown killer, Djail waited — but not for long, because the bloody letters caught fire. Djail proclaimed he had solved the riddle and would reveal the answer to everyone on the next day. The next moment, a dozen thralls turned into pillars of flame and surrounded Djail. In a single voice, they asked: \"Do you think you have exposed me, demon? What do you even know, you arrogant fiend?\"\n\"I know your name. You are Nemarius, a demigod born of the goddess Sekhmet. You and your wife-to-be were captured and forced to fight to the death in the arena. She fell, and you set yourself on fire out of grief, but were never truly gone. Your spirit is bound to this object!\" Smiling, Djail presented the brand used to mark the slaves as the arena's property. \"I used my sorcerous sight to watch you light up my words, and I felt where the threads of your spells converge. This brand left its mark on your skin and the skin of your beloved bride. It was also used to mark the slaves whose minds you dominate and use as the instruments of your revenge. Or am I wrong?\"\nThe burning gladiators howled in Nemarius's voice, but it was too late. Djail cast a spell on the brand that trapped the vengeful demigod, defeating and disempowering his foe.\nThe tradition of using hot iron to mark the gladiators ceased, and the fate of Nemarius's brand remains unknown up to this very day.",

Though unskilled in battle, the clerics and healers fought desperately, repelling one attack after another, but the sides were not evenly matched. No one was left to repel the final attack — all of the Sarenrae adepts were wounded, no one was able to raise their sword, so they met the enemy with prayer. And a miracle happened — the morning broke an hour early, and the first rays of dawn expelled the demons into the Abyss. The light healed the most terrible wounds of the mortals and brought the fallen, whether righteous or sinful, back to life. Both the believers and the misguided shed their tears. They fell to their knees as one and prayed to the bright goddess for forgiveness. And forgiveness was granted, not a single mortal died on that bloody night. The last and the brightest ray of dawn blinded everyone and took the shape of the sacred symbol of Sarenrae. They named the relic the Faultless Daybreak and placed it on the breast of a statue mounted on the site where the miracle had happened.",

Having heard about the wisdom of demon lord Areshkagal, he dared to challenge the Faceless Sphinx. Within a circle of twenty three candles, Lirk Ha'an chanted \"come and give me your most difficult riddle\" from dusk till dawn.\nWhen the last candle burned out, the dim light of the dawn revealed a woman wearing a bloody pharaoh's striped nemes. She handed a mirror mask to Lirk Ha'an.\n\"Don it, for it contains the riddle of the wise man's true face. Solve it, and boundless knowledge will be yours. But if you make a mistake, the mask will claim a part of your own visage.\"\nAs the woman vanished, Lirk Ha'an put on the mask and witnessed a conundrum of infinite complexity. He kept giving wrong answers time and again, making his face bleed like an open wound until his soul started to follow suit. Feeling his end draw near but unable to concede defeat, Lirk Ha'an embarked on a journey. He asked but a single question to every traveler he met, \"What is the wise man's true face?\" He repeated their answers, howled in pain, cruelly murdered them, and flayed their faces. Unable to move on, the souls of his victims surrounded him, covered his shoulders like a ghostly cloak, and drove him delirious with their whispers until the former sage became known in Sarkoris as the Face-Stealer. Lirk Ha'an quickly forgot who he was and only remembered the riddle he was supposed to solve.\nHe wandered the roads of Sarkoris for years until he met a renowned artificer named Xaria. The woman saw a tall gaunt figure emerge from the fog, wrapped in a shroud of spectral faces. The sage's voice cut through the barely audible murmur of lost souls: \"What is the wise man's true face?\"\nTrying to save herself, Xaria offered Lirk Ha'an her help. She promised the madman that she would create an artifact that would reveal his true visage. Lirk Ha'an brought her twenty-three dragon scales, no less and no more, a vial of prisoner blood, and the blade of an executioner's axe, then Xaria forged a blade of astonishing beauty.\n\"Wield it, and let the knife's edge show you the path to what you seek: the path to the wise man's true face,\" said she. But when the Face-Stealer touched the knife, the blade greedily plunged itself into his mask, shattering the mirror-like surface and releasing the souls of his victims into the sky.

There was a day when he was one of them, and his fame resounded from Varisia to Andoran. He traveled the world with a song and a smile, and a lovely wife at his side. He dreamt of creating the Song of All and spent years gathering sounds and notes for the melody that would encompass the entire Creation in supreme harmony. The laughter of a child and the confession of love, the triumphant cry and the gentle lullaby — all became sources for his inspiration. The journey brought the husband and wife to Drezen, where the great bard sang for the soldiers to inspire them before battle, but one night darkness descended upon Francest.\n\"You are gathering only the notes of joy, bard,\" it whispered mockingly. \"But there are so many other sounds you have never heard before,\" it murmured. \"Pay me with the blood of your love, and I will reveal them to you.\" Francest attempted to resist Nocticula's seductive voice, but to no avail — by dawn, his hand reached for the knife on its own accord.\nHe walked through the city streets covered in his wife's blood, singing a song with a happy smile on his face, and nobody dared to stop him — so terrifying and powerful was his voice. The call brought Francest to Alushinyrra where he kept gathering the notes to compose the Song of All: the cries of a mother whose children were butchered in front of her, the moans of a warrior whose hands were being chopped off, the wailing of lovers who would never see each other again. His cruelty astonished even demons. He murdered and tortured women and men, but the smile never left his face.\nYears went by, and the Song of All was almost complete. The Cursed Bard was lacking one final chord. He came to the Fleshmarkets and walked among slaves, treating them to sweet wine and even sweeter songs. The thralls watched him with hope and timid smiles. They gratefully accepted the cup he offered, but wine's tangy aftertaste quickly gave way to searing pain. The bard's wine casket was full of poison that liquefied innards, and the moans of the dying joined Francest's song as its final note.\nThe Cursed Bard drank the bitter dregs himself. He sang as he lay dying... and was happy. The demons listened to his performance with bated breath. It was the Song of All Wicked, a hymn to the darkest night where the cursed fire burns bright.\nWhen Francest fell silent, his body was reduced to rancid ooze. The poison spared only the bard's vocal cords, which the demons preserved as a grisly relic. They became a memento of the most frightful, the most remorseless song Alushinyrra ever heard.",

    "15721199-e541-4d3a-99f2-4333e3f111b2": "The city of Katapesh remembers the villainous Zaoris. As beautiful as she was depraved, this priestess was born into the family of the noble magician Conthyr. After he witnessed his daughter's disturbing inclinations, he sought to root out the little girl's taint through purifying rituals, but all of his efforts were for naught — Zaoris's heart was evil through and through. She hated her father and swore herself to the demon lord Nocticula, who gifted her with a magic pin that could seduce and enslave people's minds after it tasted a single drop of their blood. Zaoris used it to dominate Conthyr's will, then used his magic to bring death and destruction to the townsfolk of Katapesh. Her army grew day after day, as she used the pin to enthrall new servants.\nZaoris reveled in her cruelty, and her terror lasted for many years. She smiled as she handed weapons to children and promised them freedom if they spilled the blood of their fathers. She made sacrifices to Nocticula and forced her father Conthyr to incinerate entire settlements. And yet the magician managed to retain a few shreds of free will. Not wishing to serve evil, Conthyr tricked his daughter into exploring an abandoned temple of Calistria, the goddess of lust and vengeance. Tempted by treasure and unaware that the temple was cursed, Zaoris agreed, and so she and her father set out to meet their doom — together.\nThe temple's most precious treasure was the Book of Redemption. Clad in a cover of gold and jewels, it was magnificent. Zaoris thought the book contained destructive spells, but realized her mistake the moment she opened it. All the braziers in the abandoned temple flared up, and crimson words seeped onto an empty page — the Book of Redemption chronicled Zaoris's guilty acts in blood. The priestess cried out in unbearable pain as the curse struck her — any murderer who entered the temple fell prey to their own crimes, endlessly experiencing the agony felt by each of their victims. The temple doors slammed shut and the magic of the pin faded. Zaoris and Conthyr found themselves trapped at the altar.\nDelirious with pain, the priestess stabbed her father to death with the disempowered pin and then pierced her own heart, but her spirit found no rest in the afterlife. The agonized face of the priestess kept haunting the subsequent owners of the pin for years, and even after the cursed item found its way back to Nocticula, Zaoris the Crimson refused to vanish for good.",

The druid that had restored life began instead to disfigure and poison the natural world. Thenceforth, wherever he went, he spread the disease, accompanied by a pack of venomous beasts.

    "e3c7c83a-1cb2-468c-a454-2199358caeb9": "The followers of the demon lord Baphomet commit countless crimes to earn his favor. Kearius was a servant of Desna who was in charge of the temple shelter, but secretly worshiped the Lord of Beasts. He took advantage of his position to build a cunning maze in the temple's secret basement and filled it with fierce and bloodthirsty monsters. Each night, Kearius cast an overly trusting vagabond or a homeless person into the maze, where they met their grisly end.\nThe cultist spread heresy and depravity, corrupting the other priests. Baphomet took note of his servant's guile and bestowed an incredible gift upon him — a spark of the flame gracing the brow of the Lord of Monsters himself. The lantern containing this spark could summon fiery denizens of the Abyss, and its swaying could hypnotize or conjure terrifying illusions. Kearius enshrined the flame of his lord and master at the very heart of his maze.\nBut soon enough, an incredible thing happened. A lonely beggar boy — a frail and timid creature — fell into Kearius' clutches and was cast down into the maze. Somehow, he managed to survive and reach the very center of the trap. He reached out for the flame with his scraggly hands and was gone. Frightened and furious, Kearius found the empty shrine and set out to pursue the pilferer. He feared that Baphomet might learn about this failure and punish his negligent servant.\nAfter a while, he learned of entire villages reduced to ash by fiery creatures, with the survivors driven insane by the eerie glow of a sinister flame. They raved and rambled about a frail beggar boy with hellish fire in the palm of his hands.\nKearius tracked the young man down. Fear tugged at his heart and nudged him toward madness. When he finally reached the boy, the beggar laughed and turned into a cocky young man, decked in the garb of a Baphomet cultist. The grinning rogue said it was the Lord of Monsters himself who had inspired him to steal the unholy flame, and even devised the guise of the feeble child. Kearius's failure would be his downfall, and the sneaky thief would take his place as Baphomet's most loyal servant. A fight broke out where both demon worshipers sought to destroy one another, but neither could gain the upper hand. When they became tired, the Lord of Beasts' flame slipped from the thief's sweaty hands and fell onto a pile of dead branches. Fiery creatures emerged from the fire and surrounded the weakened priests, the monsters' eyes glowing like embers. The cultists pleaded with their master for protection, but their appeals fell on deaf ears. The spawn of Baphomet's flame feasted on the sinners' flesh all night, and when the fire burned out, only a tiny spark of the unholy flame was left smoldering among the remains.",

Zurga grew up to become a violent, rancorous man who despised love, friendship, and everything pure and kind. He turned all the hatred he had amassed over the years against the world that had humiliated him and dedicated himself fully to the bloody ways of Gorum. Even his fellow priests considered Zurga to be irredeemably broken and evil, which in turn made him abandon them and turn to Rovagug instead. Dreaming of total annihilation, the triumphant revenge for his suffering, Zurga gathered his own band of rascals, driven together out of fear, to commit brutal robberies and murder. The government of Sarkoris sent their militia squads eastwards to bring Zurga and his cohorts to justice, but the disaster struck when the Worldwound opened and their quest was curtailed. The Humpback was among the few madmen who were not afraid of the demonic incursion; he even managed to turn the situation to his advantage by cowing some demon worshipers into submission. Zurga made them forget their former masters by demonstrating his unrivaled malevolent strength and pursued his own unholy crusade.\nEven his own allies were not safe from his wrath, and eventually this became his undoing.

They burned down the forest and uprooted the trees, before turning their ire on the ash, but the tree was too tall and mighty for them to fell. When the creatures of the Abyss left with nothing, a boy, the only member of the Bloodwood tribe who, for some reason, had been untouched by the shaman's magic, jumped down from the tree and took his leave. He survived to pass on the legend of the Last Ash to future generations. Every ten years, his descendants would make their way into the Worldwound to the roots of the great tree and honor the memory of his fellow tribesmen. A map showing the path to this secret site had been passed down in their family for generations. All who came to the Last Ash heard the same whisper drifting through the leaves: \"The last branch will be the witness of the end of demonic rule.\" Alas, as years went by, their belief in these words grew weaker and the tree, wounded by the demons, slowly began to die. It is said to have turned into a huge stump with only one branch left. And if the tree dies before the Worldwound is defeated, the power of demons will never leave these lands.",
