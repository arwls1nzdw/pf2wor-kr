    "b43c292c-fddd-4e72-b7be-4feb4be68247": "\"Maestro Janush,\nThe problem is finally solved, and we have an incident report on all damages sustained by our organization. The company of technomancers and their robotic escort, deployed at your command, have finally eliminated this nuisance.\nI regret to inform you that very few of our men have survived the assault. The Myrmidon and lower class robots have been reduced to parts, and only one of our two precious Annihilators is still in service, although heavily damaged and beyond our capabilities to repair.\nAt least, the case of this \"Disaster on Numeria\" is finally closed for good, and the complete reports will be sent to you as soon as possible. In the meantime I can shed some light on the main lines of inquiry at play here.\nFor the moment, this seems to have been the work of a small group of powerful and well organized individuals, referred to as the Five Disasters until further information is recovered:\n-One android, unregistered, with four arms and heavily customized cyberware, which is what allowed it to cause such heavy damage with crippling and often fatal explosives. We have not been able to repair it and put it to use, all that we have able to extract is a chunk of strange nanite cloud that settles into a tangible form, and some largely corrupted data. For now, our restoration efforts have only succeeded in extracting a self-identification of \"Gears\" and several recurring names — \"Eloniel\", \"Sayeh\", \"Shindra\", \"Elfrieda\", \"Maks\", \"Byllee\" and \"Sandalee\". We are hopeful that the names of the Disasters are among them, as this is the only promising starting point for our investigation.\n-What seemed to be a female angel (possessing wings and the powerful holy aura), who greatly delayed the execution of the Disasters through her sustained curative powers. With her support the Disasters seemed to heal faster than they could be damaged, and with each heal one of our men seemed to suffer a backlash and spontaneously combust.\n-A female devil or similar beast (horns, tail, small pointed fangs, extremely nimble). She was the last to fall, even though her damage output did not seem to match that of her peers. She seemed untouchable, until the Annihilator obliterated the general region she was last seen in.\n-A human female, with very strange powers. Attacking our troops with the combination of a bow and mysterious singing, she seems to have caused sporadic mutations and a burst of aggression in her allies during battle. No traces of her or mutations remained afterwards, though we are still investigating.\n-The last case is quite unusual, and resists easy classification. An elven male or possibly half-elf in appearance, he threw himself into the fray drooling with rage and unleashing a storm of steel and lead with a blade and a handgun. Between two assaults, the android scratched him and he changed into a massive six-armed creature made of water – wreaking havoc among our ranks with claws, fangs and weapons. There is clearly still much to investigate.\nThe aforementioned Disasters seem to be behind the deaths of our agents that lead to the end of our activity at the Scar of the Spider, on the Felldale side, forcing us to return to our headquarters at Starfall.\nTheir true intentions and the motivation behind their hostilities are still unknown, our teams have always been assaulted without a word.\nDespite this hard blow you will be happy to know that our activity in Numeria should have been resumed by the time this message will have reached you.\nKalannah\nPS. I attach to this letter a box containing the remains of the android, the nanites take form and fuse, but seem practically inert and unresponsive to our experts and analysis machines. Maybe you can find some use for them.\"",

According to it, these gauntlets belonged to Victor Svalt, a human who grew up in Carrion Hill, Ustalav, and was directed by his parents to go to higher education to become a wizard. During his classes outside of his school, the class was ambushed by wild animals. In a panic Victor fled from the class and away from the city, deeper into the woods. He traveled for a great deal of time, having no supplies to sustain himself. Eventually he collapsed in the graveyard of a city in Ustalav, laying upon the loamy soil and finding it difficult to move forward. Feeling like he could make it with just a bit more energy, he decided to push on, consuming some of that awful, wretched ground and forcing his body to continue. He was then taken in by a cleric of Pharasma, and began to reside and learn the arts of a cleric under his guidance. He did not feel like eating the first few nights after his arrival, even though he felt his body screaming out for nourishment, which was concerning to him. Even so, as he went to draw water from the well near the temple one night, he saw four hooded figures standing over the well. One cradled a dark iron gauntlet in its hand, and upon approaching the well, offered it to the human. He took the gauntlets and immediately was struck and doubled over by pangs of intense hunger. Retching and heaving ensued, but when he finally recovered and stood up, the figures were gone.\nLater Victor came into contact with an Abrikandilu who shattered this gauntlet with its ability, causing Victor to fly into a rage of zeal. He used the broken shards of the item to dig into his own flesh, carving an unholy symbol of Trelmarixian on his hand to serve as a catalyst for his magic until he could repent for allowing it to break. In time, after Drezen was retaken, the gauntlet was reforged at the very forge Staunton used, and he was beginning to dabble not only the dark summoning of daemons, but also the vicious powers of blackfire. He had focused on summoning dangerous creatures and snatching souls, and the gauntlet understood this.",

Three remote areas, from melding them together in the hottest furnace inside the heart of the volcano, to the lonely, somber cold mountain condenses material without letting it fall apart in sub-zero temperatures, then lastly in tranquil lake where special waters cleanse the impurities and allow the ore to keep most of its foundations.\nFinally, back in his workshop, he began to heat up the furnace and started to hammer on the anvil. The magic from the furnace flared and sparked off many colors, as he kept hammering the mold for many days without stopping. Each hammer reminded him of the days of adventuring and obstacles that he'd overcame. From exploring the dungeons, discovering and learning new skills along the way, sailing for new horizons, to listening to his own exploits sang by the bard, little by little he imprinted a part of himself and little remaining of his own life force unto his masterpiece, until he finally completed forging something that could truly reflect himself: the Undying Shield of the Hopebringer.",

Let them accept us and see us as people — or if they try to subdue us by force, as before, let them prepare to feel our pushback! We will force them to overturn their meaningless, superstitious ban on arcane magic. We will make them see us as people, not as 'evil witches.' We will destroy the cursed prison of Threshold and set free the innocents within, doomed to wretched and unjust imprisonment. We will save Sarkoris, but only together. I therefore urge anyone and everyone for whom freedom is worth rebelling and fighting for, to join our alliance.\nYour brother in magic, Opon.'\nAnother letter is ready. I seal it with wax and leave the imprint of my signet ring in the soft scarlet substance. There's no need to hide when reaching out to comrades. My fingers cramp up, tired of holding the quill that has rewritten, over and over, the same letter for what seems like the hundredth time this morning. Clearly, I need a break.\nI twist the ring of summoning on my finger and a proud bird appears before me, its feathers gleaming with gold. The summoned bird waits patiently while I tie the letter to its leg, then it flies out the window. Yet another messenger dispatched. This bird, like so many others, will fly over Sarkoris to find a fellow practitioner of the arcane arts. Together, we can bring about a revolution. We simply must unite our efforts. It is time to change our country, to overthrow the dictatorship oppressing us, to cast off the terror that has enveloped us, to stop the ruthless hunting of innocents.\nI leave my study and look into the guest room — the poor souls are sound asleep. A boy and a girl — both spellcasters, outlaws, and criminals like me. They were on the run for three months until I offered them shelter here. They'll be hungry when they wake up — I need to get some bread and dried fish.\nAnd outside, spring awaits! The smell of flowers creeps in to tickle my nose playfully, the sun smiles, eager to embrace me with its light, and the soft wind slyly kisses my cheeks, whispering in my ear, 'It's going to be all right!' Winter is behind us, and the glorious, well-fed, and hard-working city of Iz welcomes spring! I love my city, I love the people who live here. Nowhere else have I met such selfless and heartfelt people, capable of coming to their neighbor's aid, of welcoming a stranger into their home and seating him by the hearth. They are the best people in the whole world... until they get scared.\nOh, my good Iz, how can you be so indifferent to the injustice reigning in Sarkoris?\nI'm getting emotional. Truly, my heart is soft and urges of rebellion only uneasily find a home within me. I see a girl sitting in an alleyway, shedding tears over her broken doll. I pass her by and glance back cautiously — she's sitting alone, no one else is around. The mark of a cartwheel scars her doll's mangled torso. It is beyond repair... I approach the girl carefully, take a seat, and smile at the child. She looks at me warily, but without fear. I look around again — still, no one is nearby. Ah, all right! I turn the signet on my finger, and the air above the sidewalk twists into the form of a tiny man made of whirlwinds. The garbage around him flies up in the air as the magic man starts moving, bowing dramatically, then grabs the doll and dances with it. The tears on the girl's cheeks dry instantly, replaced with laughter and joy. Then I hurry away. The tiny elemental will give the little one another minute or two of happiness, and then it will fade away. My act of kindness was a stupid risk, but... that's what we're fighting for. For freedom, for children's laughter, for the feeling in our hearts that we've done everything right and in good conscience.\n{br}Rumble and noise. The voices are loud and unkind, so scary that my dream dissolves instantly, scurrying away like a frightened animal. Stomping on the stairs, fists drumming on the door — I know these sounds. It's the sound of a night arrest, the sound of people entering a home to drag away an innocent into the night. I run to the next room, growling, 'We're leaving!' But it's too late — the door swings open and behind it there is a man with a huge black wolf at his feet. Setrei Devimai, suppressor of the voices of freedom. The scum who suffocated his own conscience while it was still in the crib. The lad I took in throws himself at the brute, yelling, 'Run, Sir Opon!' A brave kid, indeed... but where can I run? Torches and spears flank the windows, while the soultaker and his henchmen bar the door. They stand there, swords drawn, demanding my surrender. The boy is already crumpled up and lying in the corner, bent in half from the blow of that scoundrel Setrei's fist. The wolf snarls, foam dripping from its maw...\nSurrender? Fat chance, you scum! I'll never make it out of here alive, but they'll not soon forget Sir Opon! I turn the signet on my finger, ready to set a dozen soul eaters loose. Yet, I pause as a familiar face flashes in the doorway — a crying girl, next to a pale man and woman — surely her parents. They brought her to identify me, to ensure that I wouldn't escape the hunt through some trickery! What scoundrels! I will...\nI will... what? What can I do? My beloved Iz stretches out before my eyes. How many houses are there around me? How many families? How many people are sleeping in their beds right now? They are kind people, albeit unfairly cruel to us. Are you willing to bring monsters down on your city, Opon? On your neighbors? Would you watch them die screaming and choking, fighting for breath? Would you watch your monsters rip the very souls out of their children? Do you have so much hate in you, Opon? Are you really... a malevolent witch, a monster, as they claim?\nI am shaken, as if someone has walked on my grave. I stand there, shivering, afraid of myself, as time slips away. The black wolf leaps forward, his teeth sinking into my hand. My fingers, bitten off entirely, disappear down his throat, while the ring of summoning groans, crushed by horrific jaws.\nI throw myself onto the floor and roll around, screaming and thrashing about — as if it helps. The brutes drag me to my feet and punch me in the stomach. My hand hurts as if the damn wolf were still chewing on it. For all my hopes and good intentions, this is my fate...\"",

You witness the events as if you lived through them:\n{br}\"The call of a battle horn cuts through the silence of the night. Stern Brother and I leap over the palisade, knock the sleepy sentry to the ground, and race down the street — to the chief's house! Our comrades follow us in complete silence, only the long, wistful howl of the Stern Brother informs the village that the evil hour has come.\nWe barge into the chief's house, pressing frightened people against the walls with harsh looks. Three people are crouched in the back of the room, a man and a woman covering a lanky, pale lad with their bodies.\nStern Brother beside me growls — dirrrt. People fear him — a huge, coal-black wolf can terrify with a mere glance.\nI step forward.\n'My name is Setrei Devimai, and I am a witch hunter. Neither I, this wolf, nor my people will harm any good Sarkorians. We have come only for the evildoers who have broken the law and are harboring filth.'\nStern Brother inches forward, but I place my gauntlet on his scruff — it's too early, this can still be bloodless. He obeys, but he and I are not master and servant; we are brothers.\nThe man — the chief — shouts fiercely, 'We didn't hurt anyone!'\n'What do you consider evil, if you call yourself innocent? You have transgressed against your ancestors and gods, you have bred the filth of arcane power into your blood, you have intermarried your brothers and sisters in order to strengthen it. And what have you born? A freak!'\nThe man and the woman look at each other, ashamed — I caught them, a brother and sister, whom dark, unnatural forces have given the curse of sorcery.\nThe woman cries out desperately, 'Have mercy on him! He is harmless! Look, he's not right in the head! He has the mind of a baby!'\nThe pale boy clings to his mother and father — while he is big and strong, his blue eyes are naive and frightened. A child, weak in the head, a danger to no one... a clever trick.\n'Seven dead fishermen down by the river. Killed and disemboweled by magic. Good people who did no harm to anyone. Were you just curious to see what they were made of?'\nThe blue eyes stare at me blankly.\n'Children in the meadow by the Bee Grove. You just wanted to play with them, perhaps? And you didn't like losing, right?'\nHis eyes glaze over, like two blue buttons on his white face.\n'And the girl? You liked her... but you didn't like that she resisted?'\nHis full lips stretch into a smile. His expression grows serious, cruel, mocking.\n'Yes.'\nHe dispenses with his mask. Underneath, he's a clever, cunning, guileful monster who knows no compassion, knows no good. Spoiled with powers that a mortal should not have. Not a man — a witch. The lad puts his hands on his father's and mother's shoulders and takes their vitality, sucking the life out of them like a mosquito. And then he stretches his hand toward me and sends death in my direction.\nStunned and dizzy, I fall to my knees, bleeding from my ears, eyes, and nose. The gauntlets on my hands explode, cutting my fingers and palms with steel splinters. The brat raises his other hand — this is it, the end.\nThen, black lightning flashes in front of my eyes. Stern Brother leaps forward, shielding me with his body. A monstrous blow throws his furry body right into and on top of me. I find myself on the floor, his eyes in front of mine, and I realize that my brother is... dead.\nI howl. Beside myself, I throw back the body of Stern Brother, snatch up a dagger with my bloody, mangled hand, and throw it at the witch. The blade pierces his blue eye... but doesn't kill him. The boy whimpers, crawling on the floor, fumbling blindly with his hands, calling for his mother...\n'Too late! You've already killed her!'\nI rush over to him, pull the dagger out of the wound, and swing... You! You killed the one closest to me! And I'll kill you for that!\nI pull the swing back and toss the dagger down — no, I won't. The witch is insane with pain he's never felt before. He is helpless and frightened, not a threat. So he will go to Threshold, as the law dictates. I am Setrei Devimai, servant of Sarkoris. No matter how much it hurts, I won't become like... that thing. I won't kill just because I want to. As they tie up the witch, and I hug my Stern Brother for the last time.\nThis tragedy is why people should not wield arcane magic. It is no gift from spirits, not from ancestors, and not from gods. It is a curse, coming of its own accord, tempered by no watchful eye keeping track of your deeds and no voice warning of what is right and what is vile. Instead, such magic gives a sense of impunity and pride, fostering contempt for others. It debases people into monsters, for whom all others are ants.\nMy chest feels cold and nasty, plagued by a strange feeling that won't leave me. It's as if an evil even more vile and dark is lurking somewhere outside this damned house. Something I'm going to meet... and that will change everything.\nThe soldier touches my shoulder gently.\n'Sir Devimai. A messenger delivered a message from Threshold. We need to check a suspicious house. It is nearby, standing alone. According to the report, a single woman lives there.'\nThe feeling inside me grows even more rotten, but I nod silently. Duty is duty.\"",

I walk on the cobblestones of my city, wrapped in a white cloak, hiding my face under my helmet. I try to be inconspicuous, because I'm modest.\nWho will try to stop me today? I notice two men in the alley — not hunters coming for my head, just two ordinary people who didn't have time to hide. I cut their lives short, quickly and boringly, hanging their bodies upside down in the sky, using invisible harnesses. I don't touch the flesh — although we, vrolikais like to treat ourselves to our fallen enemies, I'm not killing for hunger right now.\nI hide in the shadows, listening. Someone is following me stealthily — I hear his footsteps. Walking... so vulgar. I spread my wings and soar silently into the air, taking cover behind a stone statue and waiting.\nHe reaches the place where my trail ends and looks around stupidly. Dumb, heavy, strong, and covered in layers of sturdy armor — I attack from the sky, plunging all four of my blades into the slits of his armor. The hunter dies quickly, offering me no pleasure at all. I hang him in the sky.\nThe massacre is in full swing, and no worthy opponents have tried to stop me yet. Why?\nCurious, I walk out openly into the light, haughtily inviting my enemies to take part in the fun. Three winged shadows attack in sync, circling as if in a dance, wriggling around me like a twisting whip of a balor. I too twist and turn, slashing at their sweet, fragile bodies with my daggers as they tear at me. A pleasure, but short-lived. Their bodies painted with the wounds I inflicted, the trio disappears into portals. I watch them leave — until we meet again, sinners. You are inimitable as usual. One day I will hang you upside down in the sky, but obviously not today. I'm still not satisfied.\nA couple of guests from another plane are coming my way, eager to test their strength against me. I shower them with contempt and a stream of spells that make them curl up into balls and weep. I could kill them in a heartbeat, but... I can't hang them from the sky — Our Lady in Shadow doesn't like her rules broken. Guests of Alushinyrra have to be very guilty to deserve death.\nFinally! Heavy footsteps make the sidewalk shake! This is no huntsman, it's an executioner! Finally, decent prey!\nA huge balor stands in my way. He has a sword in his right hand and a sword in his left. A fire whip won't help him in this fight, so he's armed himself with a more suitable weapon.\nI soar through the air, twisting, and evading his crushing blows — he, though massive, is fast. Such a pleasure! Leaving a thousand cuts, I make his large body weep a shower of dark blood. Pretending to hesitate, I let both his swords pierce my back. The tips come out of my chest, while all four of my daggers cut through his muscular neck, severing his horned head.\nWith that, it's over. I suspend his giant carcass high in the sky, above everyone else, for all the city to see. Let them fear my harvest.\nI walk out into the lit street, and I am stunned by the thunder of applause. The entirety of Alushinyrra thanks me for the magnificent performance, welcomes me, praises me. The bodies in the sky rotate slowly, strung up by their legs — they are my trophies. Wrapped in my white cloak, I lower my helmet-clad face. That's why they call me the Shy Lily.\nI head toward the Harem of Ardent Dreams, the hilts of balor's swords still sticking out of my back, and swaying majestically — an exquisite and refined decoration. But I'm not completely satisfied... The last enemy was good, but he alone is not enough for me. My spirit is not yet at peace.\nI enter Shamira's abode, and feel the air trembling with fear, ready to become a bloody mist at any moment. The Ardent Dream looks angrily at... a mortal standing before her shining throne? Ah, it's the new toy of Our Lady in Shadow, a mortal from the Material Plane, a witch named... Vorlesh? The woman keeps calm and looks indifferently past Alushinyrra's viceroy, as if she were nothing more than a lousy insect. What is this, a sign of self-righteous audacity or strength?\nShamira is furious, the whole city knows it. The mortal wench captured Nocticula's attention, stirred her interest. The Ardent Dream wants her dead... this Vorlesh. And I want to soothe the longing in my chest. I walk forward, listening to the conversation — heated insults against icy-cold, contemptuous indifference. Vorlesh isn't looking for a fight with Shamira, but she's not afraid of her either — and could there be a greater insult?\nThe viceroy glances around the gathering, looking for the executioner — oh, she would love to tear this mortal apart herself, but she is the one whose disobedience Our Lady in Shadow will not forgive. That's why Shamira is looking for someone to kill Vorlesh for her. I meet her gaze and nod meekly. Shamira smiles.\n'Am I correct in assuming there is no reverence in your heart for magnificent Shamira? Is that why you don't bow down to her?' — I whisper.\n'Yes, winged one. You got that right.'\nHer voice is splendid — indifferent and impassive, like a wave of Ishiar rolling against a rock.\n'Then I will punish you, mortal. You have no respect for power, relying on Nocticula's patronage. Such disobedience is followed by punishment, and even Our Lady in Shadow will acquit me.'\nMy heart sings. A proper murder! My spirit will be at peace today! The woman nods dryly. The song in my chest gets louder and happier.\n'Look out, Shy Lily! This 'mortal' will skin you, claw off your helmet along with your face, and then make you throw yourself on your own daggers!'\nI disdainfully ignore the shouts and happy laughter from the crowd. Irmangaleth, the bloody buffoon, is clowning around as usual. If he understood anything at all...\"",

You experience the events as if you lived through them:\n{br}\"The crooked, rundown house creaks when I enter, as if about to collapse on my head at any moment. I lower my hood and bow respectfully to the mistress of this... abode.\n'Ah, another highborn has arrived. What are you, sick?'\nThe old woman giggles shrilly. Her voice is repulsive and her appearance worse still. She could easily have been mistaken for a corpse wrapped in a pile of rags. Her face is unpleasant and her skin is as creased as a bat wing, widely plagued with warts.\n'I have come for healing, mother. Please be so kind as to help me.'\nThe druid chuckles nastily again — from the look of it, it's some kind of tic. She enjoys the feeling of power over me.\n'I might treat you, girl. But not for free. No, no, not for free. Do you know what price I ask?'\nI nod silently and take the gift out of my bag: meat, in slimy, bloody chunks. It is amazing how such an insignificant and common thing can be valued so highly. The old woman grabs the meat greedily, bringing it to her face, making sure it smells right.\n'You must be in real trouble, since you have come to me with fresh meat.'\nThe hag draws even closer, radiating the sickly sweet, unpleasant smell of old age. I impatiently wait for her to finish examining me.\n'You smell bad, foul... You have committed a great crime against nature, and for that you suffer,' the old woman's shrill voice becomes accusatory and imperious. 'You think you can ransom yourself from your doom? Oh no, you will suffer, you will rot, and you will bleed for your sin...'\nMy patience runs out. With a quick gesture, I unchain my anger, and the druid tumbles away, crashing into a pyramid of cauldrons, which cascade down in all directions into a crumbled mess of broken shards.\n'I grow sick of your antics. You understand who I am — fine. I know you too: you are the oldest and strongest of the servants of Mother Vulture. You know how to heal what others cannot — and you will help me, otherwise...'\nThe old woman cries out, frightened; she covers her face with her hands, her lips trembling. I wait apathetically for her to calm down. Realizing how close to death she truly is, the old woman hurries to comply. Her movements display efficiency that only fear and desperation can provide. Herbs, both commonly known and arcane, fly into the cauldron above the druid's fire. They are followed by the meat I brought, magic powders, and potions from small, cobweb-covered bottles. When the decoction boils, the old woman cautiously approaches me and grips my cloak with her knotted fingers.\nHer demand is brisk: 'Give it to me, girl. I need it.'\nI part with the cloak indifferently, and into the cauldron it goes. The old woman whispers incantations, seeming to take forever. Finally, she fishes into the cauldron with her walking stick and pulls out a wet, smelly cloak, handing it to me.\n'Put it on your shoulders. This cloak, like a leech, sucks any disease from the soul, heals any corruption. The world has never seen a relic greater than this...'\nThe cloak smells disgusting, but I don't care. I slip it over my shoulders, feeling the magic lurking within it touch my dual soul. And then... flame engulfs me! The fabric clings to my body, and the burning pain it brings is unexpectedly strong. She dared to hurt me? Me?\nI rip off the damned rag, as the old woman's shrill laughter rattles in my ears.\n'You tricked me!'\nThe old woman seems ready to dance.\n'Tricked you? Not a word I said was untrue! There isn't a relic in the world better at healing than the one I gave you! But neither magic nor gods will help you with your misfortune! You are doomed! And you shall bear your wound till your last day.'\nI clench my fist, snuffing out the old woman's life. But her body writhes and warps unnaturally — four black wings grow out of her hunched back, her wrinkled neck lengthens and splits in two, her gnarled head becomes a matching — or rather slightly mismatching — pair, and the toothless mouths on them both open wide to exude a putrid stench.\n'Mother Vulture. Do you honor me with a personal visit?'\nThe monster, with both heads lowered, looks at me intently. Its eyes sparkle with the same slyness as the last wearer of the hag's skin.\n'Begone, Architect! Neither I nor anyone else can help you. The things you've done to yourself with your own hands can never be healed. You will endure pain for the rest of your days, and after that you will perish like every other living creature, from the greatest of heroes to the meekest of swamp gnats. Such is the way of things; 'tis proper. Everything that lives, dies, so that new life can be born out of it.'\nWithout wasting any words, I retreat to the door. Even the mighty usher of Pharasma herself couldn't help me, but that doesn't mean anything. 'Impossible to heal,' she said? I've done the impossible before... and I'll find a way now.\"",

There must be an escape from solitary! I run after my sergeant, with my faithful comrades at my side. They look pale — if an alarm bell starts ringing at Threshold, it means something quite bad has happened. We run past the burning stables — the gates are locked and engulfed in flames, while a terrible, desperate cry rings out from behind the doors. No living creature should scream like that! But we don't have time to help.\nLet's go, onward! The corpses of the second shift are scattered across the ground — what evil magic could have done this to their bodies? Damned witches! One of them, his face covered in blood, emerges from a side corridor and — against all odds — doesn't get hit with a sword. He doesn't seem to be the enemy, either. I recognize him, they call him Opon. He's not a mean fellow, although you have to watch your step with everyone here. Opon points his finger where he came from and whispers, 'She went to the dungeons. Stop her, stop her at all costs.' We throw the witch to the floor, two of us stay behind to tie him up, while the rest run ahead. We reach the dungeon — the first couple runs through the doors and... they disappear, turning into two clouds of blood. The others manage to flatten themselves against the walls — while the doorway spews curses, spitting deadly, screeching spells across the air. Opon rolls around on the floor in the back, howling, 'Stop the ritual! At any cost!'\nSomething grazes my chest, and my heart skips a beat. I pant and collapse on my ass, checking my body to reassure myself — I'm alive, but there's a small black spot on the skin on my chest. Something little got me. An iron hand grabs my shoulder — it's the sergeant.\n'Ronneck, here's your order. We need to get a message out to Iz. If the ancestors help us, we can stop the witch, but if not ... they'll need to send all of the troops here. The priests and shamans are dead, the scoundrel slaughtered them immediately once she got out, so you need to carry our message. Run along, Ronneck, your quick legs are our only hope... and we'll carry on the fight here.'\nHas he lost his mind? When I look at him, my heart sinks — the left side of his body is roasted, as if he was put in a furnace! I try to object — I don't want to abandon my comrades-in-arms! I tell them that I want to fight with them side by side, that I won't let them down! They don't listen to me, drag me by the scruff of the neck to the gates, and throw me out. My chest aches nastily. Run, Ronneck, they say.\n{br}So I run. It gets harder and harder to breathe, while the black spot on my chest becomes a blotch. Maybe it's a death spell, but that's not why I'm crying. I'm crying for those we lost. Oh, bitch, you're going to pay! For everyone! For every good person whose life you took this night! How I wish I could be there and rush forward and test my sword against your spells...\nI run and try not to think that there is not a man in all Sarkoris who could get from Threshold to Iz in a single night.\n{br}Still, I run. The wind has dried my tears, my chest burning with pain. The stain spreads across my skin, and now I can see that it's rot. But I don't care. Ronneck of the Foundlast clan will fulfill his duty, just as his comrades have fulfilled theirs. Or maybe the witch is long dead? And I have to turn back before my heart beats in a deadly convulsion? I hear the hammering of rapid paw steps behind me, so I turn around — I'm being chased! A terrible beast is following me, about to catch me by the scruff of my neck.\nThere's no way you're getting me! I dodge a lunge aimed at me, then chuckle when I see the creature has smashed its face into the rock. I crank it up a notch. I'm running! I'm flying!\n{br}I'm running, but I have a feeling soon I won't be able to for much longer. My knees buckle, the air burns in my dry throat, and my heart beats like a drum. The skin on my chest is a brittle crust, crumbling away with every movement I make. I can see the white of bones. Am I going to let everyone down?! You fool, Ronneck! How can you be such a weakling and fail everyone at the crucial hour! Forgive me, forefathers! Dad, Grandpa... Mom! Mommy! Forgive me, I am such a wretched boy!\nI feel their warm hands on my shoulders, embracing me, pushing me in the back, lifting me above the ground. I hear whispers: 'Run, dear. Run, Ronnie, you've got to make it.' Fiends are following me, howling, swallowing the dust kicked up by my boots. I can feel warmth flooding through my body, and the wounds on my bruised legs stop hurting.\nThank you, forefathers! I feel your power pouring into me, as if I'm running with you. I laugh happily, picturing your fading images, seeing the faces of those I love...\n{br}I'm ru-running. Why is the sky so bright? Have I been running all night? Where am I... it doesn't matter, since I'm not in Iz yet. I've been running alone for a long time, the last one to fade was my mom's image. I know that my forefathers sacrificed themselves to help me, and we will never meet again in the afterlife.\nThe witch's corruption is working. With every step, I sway like a drunkard, about to fall over. My heart doesn't hurt anymore — maybe it dried up, too? My lungs don't hurt, and my side hasn't hurt for a long time... I would've stopped running if I could, but I haven't been running for quite a long time — my legs are running on their own. They are the heroes, and I, Ronneck, am a slug and a coward.\nAs I jump out onto the edge of a gorge, I see gray walls far ahead — is it Iz?! Oh, good gracious, it's so far away... I won't make it. I stare desperately, and then fall at last. I would cry, but I can't anymore, I can only breathe heavily and blame myself for all I'm worth... I'm ashamed! I wish I could hide from the forefathers and the gods, crawl into a hole so no one would see traitor Ronneck, or bury myself in that brushwood...\nWhat brushwood? I'm shaking like a beaten mutt, but I get up on my flaccid legs and rush there. I lean on my hand carelessly — my fingers crumble, but it doesn't matter. An alarm fire! I see an alarm fire! There used to be a lot of them around here, back when Sarkoris was less peaceful and united. Sentries would stand near these fires to signal if trouble was coming. I take out a fire striker — praise the forefathers, I haven't lost it! — I make a spark, the wind blows up the flame, and I just lie there looking at it. It's so nice to have a brief break from the running, just a moment's rest...\n{br}I awaken from a kick. Some beast stands over me — an elf woman, or maybe some lousy fiend. I look at her defiantly, as a warrior of Sarkoris should. She doesn't like it, she says: 'Lower your eyes before Anemora or I'll take them for an offering to my great lord.' Ha! Some offering! The light in my left eye has faded long ago, and I see spots in my right one... Choke on my eyes, you beasts!\nBut the fiend just won't let up: 'It could have been so simple. We would come suddenly, and your country would have fallen in a few days. And after that, the entirety of Golarion. No one would have had time to pull together to fight back, but you... you ruined it.' I giggle — what a fool! She wants the entire Golarion! Where has anyone ever seen a power capable of conquering the entire Golarion?\nI don't look at her, I look toward Iz with my remaining eye. A dark wave spills out of the mountain gorges there — the fiends are running toward the city, raising pillars of dust, hungry for blood... I hear the horn, I see the great gates of Iz opening. And out of them... good gracious! Units are marching out of them, armor shining in the dawning sun! They've seen my fire, then! They had time to gird themselves with swords and grab their axes! Now they're going to fight back! I laugh happily...\nThe monster is angry. She snaps back: 'You think it will make a difference? You just postponed the inevitable. We will still win and rule over your wretched world; as far as your feat is concerned, it will perish in obscurity along with your name. No one will know about you.'\nThe scoundrel comes up to me, pulls out a sickle, sizes me up with confidence, and — hack! — lops off my legs right above the knee. There is no pain — there is no more meat left in me, only black ashes, thanks to the damned witch.\nOh, what happened to my boots! They are all torn up, bloody scratches and broken blisters seen through the holes. Is that the proper way to treat your legs, Ronneck?\nThe fiend laughs: 'This will be my trophy. The legs of a boy who thought he could outrun death.'\nFunny! I'm laughing too! Outrun death, fat chance! I carried my death with me on my chest all night, and I knew it. But I did manage to outrun you, you crooked mug! That is why I am happy and laughing while my kin cut you monsters to pieces under the walls of Iz. And I laugh until my throat turns to ashes.\"",

His hair was long and golden, like that of angels, but his soul was wicked and warped with demonic stains. Above all, however, he was simply lost — longing to prove himself because, at his core, he was alone. He prayed to a demon lord, asking for the divine power to smite down those that did not acknowledge his abilities and then bring them back through sheer force of will. His necromantic prowess came about after decades of study, dedication, and practice. However, even this power was not enough for him. He studied forbidden rituals and, after the death of his father at Xavorn's own hands, he began the trials on the path to lichdom. His quest was abruptly ended by his companions, before he was able to reach the peak of his powers. Now he is but a whisper, a forgotten cleric. All that is left of him is a cross, fashioned from his own bones and skin.",

His duty was to seek out possible locations for an Order of the Nail outpost in the River Kingdoms, intended to bring law to the savage frontier. Raised by the brutality and cruelty of orcs, he was the epitome of self-loathing, and grew to despise his own kind. At a young age, he ran from his tribe and stumbled across a human blacksmith in a small town outside Korvosa. He was adopted by the man and raised into a fanatical follower of law and justice, joining the Order of the Nail upon adulthood. His belt paradoxically held his savagery in check while also serving as a reminder of his upbringing. Anytime he encountered a particularly savage beast or fearsome foe, he would tear some of their teeth out and add them to his belt as a reminder that the savagery within us all must be tamed by any means necessary.",
