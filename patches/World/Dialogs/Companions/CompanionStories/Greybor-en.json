The ruthless bounty hunter came to the Worldwound in search of new business. Who becomes his client and who his victim does not matter to him. The holiest zealot and the most evil demon are no different in his eyes — they are but the next target that he must eliminate.",
    "3f54ebfd-f404-4199-a561-26e966a004a9": "Just a Profession",

However, it is possible that Greybor was motivated not simply by professional etiquette, but by his genuine like of the Commander. After all, even a cynical hired killer can make a friend.",
    "4dd89711-8e02-4019-9ef7-85012dde4f8f": "The assassins guild in Alushinyrra has lost its leader and Greybor's betrayal has proven that even the most upstanding mercenary does not possess the virtue of honor. However, Greybor was never trying to become a noble crusader — he is a hired killer, loyal only to himself and his coin pouch. And clearly he will remain so to his dying day.",

It is a lucky thing that the Commander snapped up Greybor before the demons could hire him, for he would have proven a truly deadly opponent for the crusaders.",
    "0e48c07f-a67d-4a6e-a6df-acbc53827afc": "The hunt for the dragon is at an end and the job is done, but Greybor is in no hurry to leave the Commander's party, since {mf|he|she} pays handsomely for the heads of slain demons. Soon the crusaders will learn if this assassin is as good as his impeccable reputation suggests, or if he's just another venal opportunist lacking morals and honor."
