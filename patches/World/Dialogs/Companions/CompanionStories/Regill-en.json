    "1085bebd-a94d-422a-abf9-d0a7c7c41a31": "Regill Derenge is as straightforward as they come, but predictable? Never. It turns out that he has hatched a plan to bring the Commander and the Hellknights together. And to execute this plan, Regill sacrificed his own rank and reputation without a second thought.",
    "45ba26c7-3a4d-401f-a63c-7721a505a797": "The whitish locks of hair on his head mark the time until his inevitable death. Yet, his own fate doesn't seem to worry Regill Derenge, a Hellknight to his very core. For those who hone themselves into living weapons, there is no greater purpose than to strike. However, only time will tell where this strike will land.",
    "8abce737-8a71-4d69-816d-8dcfbed966bc": "Trust — does Regill Derenge understand the concept? Apparently not, for he did not hesitate to arrange a test for the Commander, a challenge designed to identify {mf|his|her} weaknesses and traitorous ambitions. Only one thing is clear — Regill will not serve anyone out of a sense of loyalty or friendship, but out of respect? Yes. However, respect must be earned."
