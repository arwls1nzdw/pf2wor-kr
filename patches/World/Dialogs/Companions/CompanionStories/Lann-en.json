    "663cc4cf-8c62-4211-afa0-d13f2b2aa689": "In Alushinyrra, the majestic city in the Abyss, Lann had a second encounter with Savamelekh — the demon who corrupted the mongrels and Wenduag's master. Though Lann's body, the twisted product of generations of demonic corruption, failed him at this crucial moment, his spirit is enraged like never before and is demanding justice. No matter the cost.",
    "31ad21c8-f891-4d31-8220-1ab88bc68a3b": "Lann the mongrel is a curious sight even for the distorted land of the Worldwound. A descendant of the first crusaders, a child of the caves beneath Kenabres, he followed his new leader up toward the light of the foreign sky. It seems that nothing can shake his composure, but is that really true? How strong is a man's resolve, built upon a self-imposed death sentence?",
    "fe40cd97-6401-4008-9146-a2aec0f5589f": "Lann, after promising to lead the mongrels to the surface, once again met the woman who had meant so much to him, the woman who had betrayed not only their friendship, but all their mongrel kind. However, this bitter encounter was worth enduring for one reason — the mongrels are now fully settled in Drezen, no longer the underground crusaders, but the Commander's crusaders.",
    "a79329be-b474-4b85-8527-8b652375d46a": "The fight with Savamelekh ended in victory, and Lann, realizing that he did not die in his feat of heroism, now looks to the future with optimism. He wants to believe that the gods will show mercy to the mongrels, and that gradually the scourge that has destroyed their lives will dwindle away to nothing."
