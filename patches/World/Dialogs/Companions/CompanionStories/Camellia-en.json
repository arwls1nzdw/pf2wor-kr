    "256af690-5551-4c53-9dec-49e18c9b10f6": "Camellia has both youth and talent in her favor. She tirelessly fights demons and cultists alike, but prefers to keep her distance from her fellow warriors. It's hard to tell if this is the arrogance inherent to some people of noble birth, or if she has another reason for keeping her companions at arm's length.",
    "75206ae0-bf79-460a-ba94-9f7009932305": "More than one dark tale lurked behind the grand dwelling's handsome facade. After lifting the veil on her secrets, Camellia found a friend in the Commander, someone she can lean on as she works to help all of Sarkoris. The end justifies the means, after all, especially if one has noble intentions.",
    "f90864d4-3f2b-463b-a3f2-fbfdc7f64458": "The final deception has been exposed. The noble intentions in the name of saving Sarkoris turned out to be nothing more than a pretty lie covering up the bloody truth. And still, the Commander forgave this deception â€” after all, what wouldn't you do for a friend who had traveled such a long road at your side? Camellia's calculation proved correct.",
    "58bce42a-5140-4764-9cd0-fd6c682c2274": "The fleeting adventure revealed a rather unexpected truth to Camellia. What is your heart's desire? What secret urges dwell within it? If these questions are ever answered, life will never be the same again."
