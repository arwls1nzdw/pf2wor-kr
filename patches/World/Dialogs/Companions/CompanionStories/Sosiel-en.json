    "2c87ece1-c991-4449-a253-bae6a4ad8f05": "For good or ill, the young cleric found his brother. War and captivity have greatly affected Trever — the person Sosiel once so admired lives on only in his memory. The old Trever is gone for good, but perhaps his case will help Sosiel save others from the same tragic fate?",
    "3f33fc27-975c-4a7d-a42e-c642b9ee8f0d": "His ambition to serve as a healer was not the only reason why Sosiel was drawn into the ranks of the crusaders. He is searching for his brother, a paladin who went to war and vanished without a trace. All attempts to discover his fate thus far have led to nothing: the threads trail off, the barest clues come to dead ends. But Sosiel will not give up. The young cleric knows that if Trever is alive, Sosiel will bring him home. And if he isn't, Sosiel will bury him.",
    "c2c6b04e-70f7-418c-9850-8ebf39f40b43": "Sosiel learned the bitter truth about his brother's fate: the war broke the paladin, turning him into a ruthless Hellknight. Wherever Trever may be now, Sosiel has no hope of finding him. But how can he come to terms with the knowledge that Trever is no longer the person he knew before? And — a more frightening question — if Trever has turned evil, will Sosiel be able to avoid attacking him should their paths ever cross?",
    "0d018dd8-1096-4041-936e-7bed1ef7174e": "What is this soft, kind man doing in a war? It is easier to imagine him harvesting ripe grapes than killing enemies. But he came here, and his hands are scarlet not with berry juice, but with the blood of slain enemies and fallen friends. This servant of the goddess of beauty gives all of himself to his comrades, trying to protect as many lives as he can. But who will protect him?"
