After having one too many drinks, he accidentally set a supply cart ablaze during the demonstration of his \"improved alchemist's fire.\" Zagelforntz was apprehended on the spot by an outraged quartermaster, and the officers now demand the banning of libation among the crusaders. The High Priest of Nerosyan is in favor of this proposal, since drunken crusaders damage the crusade's reputation.",
