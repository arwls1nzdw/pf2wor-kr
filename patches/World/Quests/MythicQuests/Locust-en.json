How can the Commander fend off this attack on {mf|his|her} body, mind, and soul?",

She knows a great deal about her master's secrets, of which ordinary cultists remain ignorant. Now she is hiding somewhere on the outskirts of Iz, and she will find the Commander on her own. A meeting with Anemora could give the Commander the key to victory over Deskari.",

When they were in conflict, the demon lord did not destroy her, but only because he did not wish to anger her patroness, Lamashtu. But, as it turned out, he did not let her go completely unpunished. Yet another swarm in the Commander's path — it may not be the strongest, but it hates Deskari with a passion. What is Izyagna prepared to do to help the enemy of her enemy?",

Should {mf|he|she} even be called by that title now? What does this creature have in common with the mortal who was named the \"commander of the crusade\"? These words hold no meaning at all now, for there is no crusade. Now this is a war between two swarms — the young and bold versus the old and cautious. From the mortals' point of view, this is now a fight between two monsters, and whichever emerges victorious will quickly turn its sights on mortalkind.",

Of course, to achieve a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, one requires more sophisticated formulas. For instance, we are currently observing a single locust from a powerful and ancient swarm that has infiltrated a newly fledged one, imperiling the latter's very existence.
