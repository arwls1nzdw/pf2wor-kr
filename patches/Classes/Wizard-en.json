These bonus spell slots must both be used to prepare the same spell from the wizard's school of specialization, allowing the wizard to cast that spell twice. The wizard cannot use these slots to prepare two different spells, even if they are of the school he is specialized in.\nRestrictions: A Thassilonian specialist does not get to customize his choice for opposition schools — that choice is selected for him when he chooses his specialization. These restrictions are more significant than those most wizards follow, and are known as prohibited schools. A Thassilonian wizard can never prepare a spell that is in one of his prohibited schools — he treats these spells as if they were not on the wizard spell list. If using a spell trigger or spell completion item to cast a spell from one of his prohibited schools, he must use the {g|Encyclopedia:Use_Magic_Device}Use Magic Device{/g} {g|Encyclopedia:Skills}skill{/g} to do so.",
