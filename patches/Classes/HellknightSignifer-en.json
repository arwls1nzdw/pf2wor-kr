They wear masks — often featureless — to mark themselves as impersonal agents of order, unswayed by empathy, detached from emotion, and dedicated to passing impartial judgment upon all lawbreakers. A signifer's distinctive mask is a symbol of his devotion to the precepts of law and exacting justice, and it serves as the focus for several of his signifer powers. Traditionally, signifers are arcane or divine spellcasters.",
