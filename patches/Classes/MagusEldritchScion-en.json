This arcane pool has a number of points equal to 1/2 his magus level (minimum 1) + his {g|Encyclopedia:Charisma}Charisma{/g} modifier. The pool refreshes once per day when the magus prepares his {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spells{/g}.\nAt 1st level, a magus can expend 1 point from his arcane pool as a {g|Encyclopedia:Swift_Action}swift action{/g} to grant any weapon he is holding a +1 enhancement {g|Encyclopedia:Bonus}bonus{/g} for 1 minute. For every four levels beyond 1st, the weapon gains another +1 enhancement bonus, to a maximum of +5 at 17th level. These bonuses can be added to the weapon, stacking with existing weapon enhancement to a maximum of +5. Multiple uses of this ability do not stack with themselves.\nAt 5th level, these bonuses can be used to add any of the following weapon properties: flaming, flaming burst, frost, icy burst, keen, shock, shocking burst, or speed.\nAdding these properties consumes an amount of bonus equal to the property's base price modifier. These properties are added to any the weapon already has, but duplicates do not stack. If the weapon is not magical, at least a +1 enhancement bonus must be added before any other properties can be added. These bonuses and properties are decided when the arcane pool point is spent and cannot be changed until the next time the magus uses this ability. These bonuses do not function if the weapon is wielded by anyone other than the magus.\nA magus can only enhance one weapon in this way at one time. If he uses this ability again, the first use immediately ends.",
