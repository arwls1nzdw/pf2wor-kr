That is what I was thinking, when I accepted an invitation to a wedding feast at a small Mendevian village near the Estrovian Forest.\nIt was a hot summer, so the tables were set outdoors, in the middle of an apple orchard. I was seated between a sullen girl of about fifteen and a cheerful old lady with a few scars on her face. The simple village dishes smelled wonderful. The musicians were playing cheerful tunes and slowly getting drunk, and the groom was glowing. The bride sat staring at the table, with her blue eyes every so often wandering to her flower crown.\nA frightening, unsteady howl came from somewhere beyond the orchard and broke the idyll. I turned to my elder neighbor with a silent question in my eyes.\n'It's Nelika's dog. The bride's. It went mad last night, and won't stop howling, so they locked it up in the barn. Jealous of her mistress no doubt!'\nI quickly got up, and the adolescent girl who sat beside me followed along.\nIt wasn't difficult to find and untie the dog. It was a huge shepherd, and it jumped up to greet me, apparently sensing the power and goodness of my faith. He whimpered quietly, almost crying. Then he ran outside and led us with him.\nWe went down to a ravine, in the shadows beneath some weeping willows. We were greeted by sad blue eyes gazing at us from a dead pale face. The body of Nelika, the bride who we'd seen at the feast just a few minutes ago, had been pinned against the trunk of a dry tree by some horrible force. The dog sat at her feet and howled again.\nI ran back rapidly, praying to the goddess. I know a monster that likes to kill young women to take on their appearance and destroy their family. These monsters worship powerful demon lords, the very embodiment of chaos, abomination, and evil. The powers of a humble healer would hardly be enough to stand against such an opponent, but how could I leave those people in such peril?\nI collected myself as I approached the doors of the bedroom, where they'd already taken the young couple. I flung open the door and exhaled the words of a prayer.\nAn unnaturally large creature stood over the young man's body. It yelped at the blow that my prayer had dealt, and turned around immediately. Shimmering steely-gray skin, monstrous claws, ugly features — it was an annis, the most horrible of hags. The illusion that made her look like Nelika had fallen, and the bride's flower crown sat mockingly on the matted hair of her huge head. She raised her hand, preparing to cast her spell on me, but a shaggy shadow leapt from behind my back and pinned the hag to the ground, clenching its fangs around her throat. The dog had come to avenge his owner.\nBut hags don't hunt alone. Behind my back there was another annis from the coven, who had pretended to be the old lady at the table. A terrible claw reached out to me, but halted midair. 'You!' The hag whispered, baffled, and immediately fell from a blow to the throat.\nThe adolescent girl wiped the blood from her hand and winked at me. Her eyes were different colors, one was blue, and the other was green.\n'Family matters. Well, priestess, shall we go check on the poor groom?'\nAlas, the happy village wedding turned into a funeral for the dead: Nelika, and her elder relative who the hags had killed to sneak into the feast. At least we were able to save the groom. I was staring at the young man's icy eyes, and the shaggy dog sitting at his feet, and I knew they wouldn't be staying much longer in the village. Soon the Mendevian crusaders would have a new recruit and his dog in their ranks — two more souls with a grudge against demons and those who follow them.\nBefore leaving the village, I visited the girl — a foundling cared for by the village herbswoman. 'Why did you decide to go against the coven?' I asked her softly.\n'I was born fifteen years ago, after a similar wedding. Hags often bear the children they conceive, after killing the bride and taking her place in the groom's bed. Such children usually follow in their mother's footsteps, but I decided I preferred to be human.'\nI nodded. I might have not been able to rest carelessly at a celebration, but this was worth it. The child of a monster had stepped onto the path of redemption, and spared the world from the very evil that had spawned her.\"",

On the other hand, the origins of sorcerers' power are beyond counting, from inheriting it from an extraplanar progenitor to acquiring it from a conjunction of celestial bodies. There is but one trait that they have in common: all sorcerers wield power that is utterly undeserved, not having stirred a finger to obtain the arcane might they possess. Of course, they take great pride in their ability, fancying it a gift from a higher power, perhaps even a sign of being some kind of chosen one. Such an attitude is especially prevalent among the barbaric cultures. Take giants, for example — despite the massive weight of their colossal brains, these creatures despise learnedness and only respect innate magic, relying on superstitions to explain its origins.\nMy attention was drawn to one of the legends as told by the frost giants of old Sarkoris, the ancient belief in magic bones. It is impossible to recall it in detail because after the demonic invasion, the frost giant tribes were either exterminated or driven away by the ash giants, but one can still find the ruins of their temples and domiciles inside the Worldwound. Judging by the remaining statues and bas-reliefs, these tribes believed a certain divine entity had been murdered or sacrificed. Its bones entered the mortal giants, granting them power over ice and cold. According to legend, the bone exits the body of its former owner upon death and seeks a new host, transforming them into a sorcerer. Spellcasters assumed to be bearers of these bones often rose to prominence as chiefs, sometimes uniting a few families into larger clans for more effective raiding...\"",

It sounds like a load of rubbish to me, but I'm not going to argue with a paladin of Iomedae who's three times taller than me and twice as wide. Not a chance.\nNo incidents today.\nDay 2\nNo incidents today.\nDay 3\nCaptain Ling told me that he won't tolerate my 'casual attitude' to the expedition anymore (!!!). These paladins are just bullies. They'll happily beat the living crap out of you — while explaining that it's all for the greater good, blah, blah, blah. But fine, I'll behave. I am Binaban Rizzel, a gnome, an explorer, and a pathfinder, assigned by the Grand Council of Absalom to help the paladins of Iomedae on their expedition into the Enigma. I wish I had never written that article about Areshkagal's secrets. If I had known all the trouble it would cause me, I would have never published it in the first place. Damn it, Ling, why am I writing all this? You know perfectly well who I am, and what I am doing here.\nI don't think that a few prompt killings of a bunch of lesser demons by a squad of well-armed blokes can qualify as incidents, so no incidents today either.\nDay 4\nWe've been walking in circles around this stone labyrinth for four days now. My legs are killing me, truth be told. Oddly enough, the food is good. I was expecting field rations — some nondescript gruel, but it turns out that Iomedae's paladins aren't opposed to a good dinner. The walls of the labyrinth are covered in strange writing. Some of the inscriptions are truly ancient. They date back to Earthfall times. Others have been made more recently. And then there are some that I don't recognize at all... and I'm a linguist, mind you! Whenever I fail to translate an inscription, Captain Ling frowns and turns away. But what am I supposed to do?\nWe have found significant evidence that all kinds of creatures from different planes, and even different worlds, used to visit the Enigma. I have already spotted the unholy symbols of the demon lords Baphomet and Aldinach. While the presence of the latter is unsurprising — the sisters have been at each other's throats since birth — the appearance of Baphomet and his cultists is quite intriguing... What does Areshkagal, the Keeper of Secrets, have in common with the Lord of the Minotaurs? Except for their irrepressible fixation on these damned dark labyrinths, of course.\nSpeaking of which, Ling. Don't you think that four days is a long enough time for a reconnaissance mission? I'm starting to get homesick.\nDay 5\nYou won't believe what happened today! While trudging through this damned labyrinth, we bumped into a group of Areshkagal's cultists — a bunch of ragamuffins wearing white masks. Ling hailed them, but when they produced some rusty knives and tried to fight, they were quickly killed for their foolishness. Serves those idiots right. That'll teach them to choose their cultish beliefs more carefully. But that's beside the point. What was strange about these cultists is that they weren't just dying — when they were cut down, they crumbled into dust, and vanished into nothing! Their bodies disappeared completely! It was unbelievable! All that remained of the cultists were their white masks. Of course, our brave paladins trampled them with their boots, but I managed to salvage one intact. Ha! So what are you gonna do to me now, Ling? Will you try to take it away from me? You wish! According to our contract, you agreed to let me collect non-life-threatening, non-magical archaeological artifacts. So, I hereby officially declare that this totally useless white mask is an archaeological artifact! I intend to wear it, walk around wearing it all day, and even go to sleep with it on! And you can do absolutely nothing about it!\"\nThe last entry is written in an uneven, shaky hand that bears little resemblance to the previous entries.\n\"Day 6\nAll right, Binaban, focus. Pull yourself together, you spineless moron! So, I woke up a moment ago. I stretched. And then I started to wonder why I hadn't heard the paladins. They never allow me to get a good night's sleep! So I look around, and they're all lying on the ground — dead. Their fingers were curled up into fists, their hair was white... some of them had their hands clutched to their chests, and others had pissed their pants. It was as if they had all seen something horrible... something terrifying. But I know what they saw. Areshkagal's ugly mug, that's what! The legend says that anyone who takes a peek under her mask will either go crazy, or die where they stand. So, I was just over here, sleeping like a baby in my little mask, and they... Well, Areshkagal came to pay them a visit, and...\nSo why the hell am I still writing in this stupid notebook? Ling is dead! Kicked the bucket, and all his fellow paladins with him! That's it, kaput! I have to get out of here! I need to pick a direction — it doesn't even matter which one — and try to find the exit! And I need to keep the mask on. I have no idea what it really is, but without it, I'd be lying next to Ling now, cold and dead.\"",

It was for this mission that we left our people, who are so desperate for solace and protection in these times, and followed Eliandra, our mentor, into Pulura's temple. Here, cut off from the mortal world, we shall continue our service blessed by the Shimmering Maiden. Though the foul smoke of the demonic pit clouds the skies, Pulura reveals to us the stars that will guide our way!\nDay 24\nWe carry on our holy work that praises the illustrious Pulura. The enchantments that keep us safe are flawless — the demons outside the sanctum's walls don't even suspect its existence. I embolden my spirit by praying to Pulura for a swift deliverance from the vile hordes that swarmed our lands. We just need to gather our strength and wait for the brave warriors to throw the unholy beasts back into the Abyss. I have faith that such a day is nigh!\nDay 105\nThis is a momentous occasion — my brothers finished working on another map of the northern sky! At times, when I look into everyone's eyes, I see worry of what is happening outside the temple walls, and I feel doubt creeping into my heart as well. But in the next moment, I shame myself for being so weak of will. Today is a good day, and I will not allow it to be tarnished by dreary thoughts.\nDay 258\nSister Eliandra's prayers have been answered, as our abode was visited by a messenger of Pulura! Alas, the celestial brought dire news: our homeland has been overtaken by flames and demonic spawn, the cities are burning, and the people are fleeing for their lives. The tear in the Material Plane has not yet been mended — on the contrary, it's spewing out more Abyssal legions by the hour. The celestial left us, but not before he assured us that we are not forgotten, and our service has not been for naught.\nWe must steel our hearts and continue searching among the stars. The quicker we can finish our work, the sooner will Sarkoris have hope for salvation!\nDay 457\nWe spent half a day looking for brother Areed. Eliandra herself found him, behind the altar of Pulura. He was crying, sitting on the floor, hugging his knees close. I was afraid that she would scold him for this treacherous weakness of spirit and mind that could poison the others. But my fear was unfounded. Eliandra and Areed spent two hours in conversation that remained a mystery to all of us, then our brother returned to work, still saddened — yet now he held his head a little higher. I bow before our leader's wisdom and fortitude... but do I see in her eyes a shadow of that same despair that has long since found its way into our hearts?\nThe day the messenger arrived\nOn the day we finished mapping out the eastern hemisphere, our solitude was broken — this time, by a messenger from Iomedae. I curse my own curiosity for encouraging me to join those who listened to her words. The battle still rages on around us, yet nobody fights for Sarkoris anymore. Warriors from some other lands are clashing with demons, treading on the ashes of our kin. Sarkoris is gone. They now call it the Worldwound.\nAnother day, just like many before it\nI can no longer keep track of days — they all have merged into one endless strip of gray. Even Pulura's starlight cannot drive away the darkness in my heart. Our service has been in vain. We have nothing to go back to. All I have left is to languish here, day in and day out, fulfilling my duty to my brothers and sisters. And thus, day in and day out, do I toil without a moment's rest, all in the name of our sacred and — Pulura forgive me — pointless duty.

Read of their greatest accomplishments, neophyte, be awed, and be inspired.\nIn the year 4664, at the dawn of our service in the Worldwound, our brothers began to infiltrate the ranks of those called to serve Mendev and the rest of the mortal world. The crusaders paid no regard to whom they were recruiting, and soon the templars found the perfect material for their work. One night, two Orders that shared a Mendevian outpost suddenly discovered irrefutable evidence that both parties had been hobnobbing with the demons in hopes of saving their hides just before an upcoming surprise attack. The consequences were immediate, and by morning, the army had turned into squabbling packs that had completely shed the veneer of noble ideals in their fight for righteousness.\nIn the year 4665, with the onset of the Third Crusade, a saint appeared in the ranks of Iomedae's church — a pure and brave maiden who inspired new warriors. Unsurprisingly, among her admirers was a hot-blooded young man whose adoration went beyond the bounds of virtue. Leading a selfless heart to sin was no easy task, but the templar had taken lessons from Alushinyrra's incubi for a reason. Our brother unleashed in the maiden the overwhelming depths of passion and sin, but as soon as the church caught wind of the orgies that were taking place in the heart of the new Order, bonfires flared up — not just for Iomedae's ward, but for her followers too, including the brave templar who had revealed his true face to her on the eve of their execution.\nIn the year 4667, a famed inquisitor, who was particularly enthusiastic about roasting peasants at the stake, suddenly grew despondent. And for good reason: his closest friend opened his eyes to the rampant demon worship right under his holiness's nose — in the ranks of the inquisition itself. This butcher had his work cut out for him, and in his great purge, he hanged and stabbed whomever his friend pointed at. Alas, all good things must come to an end, and soon the poor inquisitor was apprehended and sent to the capital to stand trial. Before his execution, he made futile attempts to call his trusted friend as a witness, yet the friend had gone missing, or maybe had never existed at all. The templars know how to cover their tracks.\"",
    "81498dc5-f956-4b18-8225-918e2787e5df": "\"Experiment day one\nToday I was able to catch a quasit. Irori be my witness, it wasn't easy, considering my humble physical condition. Luckily, it was a scrawny specimen, about seven pounds, with a wingspan of about two and one third feet. When it awoke, the quasit first tried to attack me, and then ruined my clothes with his caustic saliva.\nExperiment day three\nI have begun my linguistic research. My goal is to study the language of quasits. I'm quite convinced they have their own dialect. Through understanding their speech, I will be able to understand their way of thinking, and convince them to rebel against their lords' tyranny. A revolution will roll through the Abyss, and the powerless will rebel against their oppressors. I'm sure that Everbloom Milani will not refuse her patronage even to such creatures as these, if they would break their chains of slavery.\nUnfortunately, progress is thus far insignificant. I've been able to catalog only two words, which I suspect must mean 'rend' and 'carrion'. The quasit formed both words quite vividly when commenting on my person.\nWhile I was entering this record, the quasit managed to steal my watch and throw it into the chamber pot. Judging by his spiteful giggling, he's quite delighted about his little joke. And despite the naughty trick, I am somewhat glad. Jokes and pranks are a part of cognitive communication, which I fully intend to establish with the specimen. I grow more and more convinced that I made the right decision in leaving Absalom and Forae Logos, the so called Wise House. More like narrow-minded fools stuck in the past, under the sway of their ringleader, that chatterbox, the fool of fools, Jubilost Narthropple. They've never appreciated the progressive nature of my theories.\nExperiment day four\nToday the quasit almost bit my nose off while I fed him. In response, to my shame, I beat him with a wand. Such behavior toward a sentient being is unacceptable, and I repent deeply. I've also run out of meat. The specimen and I will have to make do with porridge and soup.\nExperiment day six\nIt's been three days since the specimen switched to a vegetarian diet. At first the quasit refused to eat plant-based food, but then ate some cabbage soup and poked at the porridge with his claw. His face looked so tragic.\nExperiment day seven\nThe specimen has completely lost all signs of aggression. At dawn I was awoken by his moaning. The quasit was rolled up in a ball in the corner, whimpering. Despite his dangerous appearance, it's quite impossible not to feel compassion toward the poor creature. I had to take prompt measures and give the specimen a laxative potion. The quasit now reacts to me with confusion and fear, but at least it's not suffering any more. His gastrointestinal tract must have reacted unhappily to the unfamiliar diet.\nExperiment day ten\nWhat a great day! The switch to a completely plant-based diet is complete! The theory that quasits can only eat meat and carrion has been disproven! My eternal opponent, Sir Jubilost, will just have to go drown himself in a river!\nThe quasit has became peaceful and easygoing. He no longer tries to eat my boots, or the feet inside them. The specimen's behavior has become gentle and friendly. He shows some interest in ball games and physical exercise. I have named him Pekker.\nToday he initiated communication, and attempted to explain a new word to me. By all evidence, he was making up the word during the communication process, for there has never been such a word in the quasit language. The meaning, as I understand it, is 'safety, comfort, and calm'.\nI see no further need to keep Pekker on his chain. This experiment has convinced me that the vicious and evil traits attributed to quasits are acquired habits, not natural or inherent to their nature. Over these days I really have grown fond of him. And by all evidence, Pekker likes me too. He's gotten used to napping on my knee while I'm writing my observations in my journal. Maybe someday this quasit will become my familiar.\nThe current stage of the Experiment is complete. Pekker and I are soon off to Absalom, to present our findings before the professors at Forae Logos and become a scientific sensation. On our way, we may make a small detour to Avistan, so that Pekker will have a chance to better adapt to civilization. I hope the little trickster enjoys the journey.\"",

The next cyclus of miniatures depicts various scenes from a woodworker's workshop — this form of craftsmanship held almost sacred status in Sarkoris. Several views of the city of Iz, the masterpiece of Sarkorian architecture, can be seen in the following series of engravings. Finally, the last painting, \"The Threshold Prisoners,\" portrays a group of spellcasters imprisoned in the infamous prison tower. The origin of the picture is unclear, but the woman in shackles that can be seen in the background is widely believed to be the Betrayer of Humanity Areelu Vorlesh herself.\n\"Yaniel by a Fountain.\" This painting is attributed to Deniza Roche, a soldier from the garrison of Kenabres. Deniza was not a professional artist, yet she had one advantage over the professionals who created later portraits of Yaniel the Blue-Eyed: the heroine of the First Crusade sat for this unique picture personally, which undoubtedly gives it much greater historical value. Yaniel is caught during a rare moment of repose near a fountain in the city. The portrait was presumably painted from life over the summer of 4637, one year before Yaniel's heroic death during the battle for Drezen.\nReliquary exhibits:\nWand of Zacharius. The wand of the famous mage Zacharius who made his name during the heroic and tragic siege of the Lost Chapel. As the fortress warden, he sent his apprentices to break the siege in order to save the priests who served the Chapel's many gods. Zacharius himself refused to leave the fortress, however, and is believed to have perished in the final onslaught.

This item was donated to the museum by Zacharius's apprentice, mage Teldon.\nVessel of Raellas. This copper vessel and the oil inside it were sanctified by Raellas, priest of Iomedae and faithful crusader. A batch of lamp oil had been brought to the crusaders' camp, and Raellas took the vessel to move it to the storehouse. Raellas's faith was so deep that it made the oil shine all by itself, and the vessel became covered with engravings praising the goddess. This item was donated to the museum by Raellas's fellows in arms.\nHelmet of Scroccia. This helmet belonged to Bathistas Scroccia, paralictor of the Order of the Gate and one of the first Hellknights to serve his duty as a crusader. During the most unstable and dangerous first weeks of the war, Scroccia saved the Crusade from infighting between the worshipers of different gods. When a Hellknight killed a paladin of Iomedae in a personal duel, Scroccia stopped the imminent bloodshed by stepping up for his soldier and taking the blame for his deed. This was far beyond his duty, but Scroccia defended the honor of his Order by proposing to wash out the insult with his own blood. Scroccia agreed to be beheaded in exchange for a peace treaty between the two orders. His death put an end to the rivalry in the crusader ranks once and for all, and his sacrifice will be remembered by all crusaders forevermore. This item was donated to the museum by Queen Galfrey, Sword of Iomedae.\nTerendelev's Claw. This is a claw taken from the silver dragon and protector of Kenabres.

It's been three years since you visited your native lands, and your father at your family crypt. Last summer some passers-by broke the lock on it and spent the night inside. As steward, I installed a new lock and cleaned up all the wreckage.\nYour servant who went missing, whom you inquired after in your previous letter, has indeed been seen but at present his precise whereabouts are unknown. He came to us, looked at us with contempt, said something through his teeth, gathered taxes for you, ate a whole goose for free at the tavern, jumped on his horse, and galloped off. If he went missing somewhere on the road, we wouldn't know anything about it. It's been a complete disaster here, even without missing strangers to account for.\nSeven days ago, all cows gave black milk. And the milkman, who tasted it out of drunken stupidity, died in the pain of twisted bowels. There is something wrong with the spring. The water stinks of rotten eggs, and the cattle won't drink it. Besides, some scoundrel threw some dead dogs into the closest well, the one on the crossroads, so we've filled it with soil. I expect the demons are giving us trouble any way they can. Our cattle are dying of thirst.\nChildren are going missing in your protected forest. The woodcutters saw some scarecrows which they swore were alive. They spoke of angry faces and bared teeth. They were afraid to get too close, and watched them from afar. Frightening things are going on in the woods. I fear that witches and demons have settled in your protected forest, to do their wicked mischief.\nThey are probably the ones who picked the bones of your servant who's gone missing. And you ask us, as if you suspect us of being involved. As if we could kill and rob an honest man. It's upsetting, Sir Willam. We never touched your servant, and if we did, he was a wretched man, smug and nasty. And we have no food or water, and our children are going missing.\nInstead of serving your Lady Galfrey, you should be home defending us, and bringing us food. You must have some gold, lord that you are. There is no one to protect us besides you. The city lads only come to find new recruits and take our gold. They don't have the authority to do anything more. And the send-off we give our lads and lasses they take — the whole village comes to say farewell, just like it's a funeral. None of them have returned home to the village yet. We are dying.\nSo I'll tell you the honest truth, Sir Willam, we cannot live like that any more, but we cannot die in such terrible conditions either. So we agreed with our neighbors to burn down your forest on the next new moon, your protected forest where the dark beasts live. We'll surround it, set it on fire from all sides, and hire a wizard to steer the wind. We won't be put off just because the forest is protected, or because no one may shoot game there or enter therein, or cut down its trees. Of course you'll be very angry at us for burning down your family forest. Because we've already been cutting its wood and shooting game there, for there is nothing else to eat and no other wood. We won't let the forest beasts steal our children. If you wish, come and execute me, execute all of us, but we won't put up with this any more.

I became a sculptor's apprentice when I was seven, and by twenty five I had already become a reputable and ambitious debutant. Alas, this didn't bring me any happiness.\nMy first piece of art, a composition called 'The Last Azlanti Takes a Step into the Lands of the Axis,' caused a stir... and most reactions were shouts of indignation. For some reason, the public decided that my depiction of Aroden bore a striking resemblance to the Chairman of Absalom's Grand Council, Lord Woors. They accused me of being corrupt and subjected me to a shameful beating right at the grand opening!\nI attributed this calamity to my youthful inexperience, and I intended to turn the tables. To avoid further accusations, I chose a topic that was pronouncedly distant from Absalom's realities. So I depicted the Tian goddess-warrior, 'Tchizuru.' How could I have known that so many people from Tian Xia live in Absalom? And why did none of them warn me that the name of the goddess is actually spelled and pronounced 'Shizuru' or that misspelling it is a great blasphemy? How could I even suspect that one part of my audience would be outraged by the excessive bellicosity of my statue, the other would be insulted by its extreme femininity, and the rest would brand me a parasite trying to make money off of undisguised cultural appropriation?\nFeeling desperate, I turned to abstractionism! And when the time had come to give a name to my statue, I chose a random set of letters, consonants only — but caused even more trouble. That very night, a bunch of strangers clad in hooded black robes broke into my house, threatened me with daggers, and demanded that I never again try to depict their mysterious deity or mention one of its secret names.\nHaving failed at gaining glory among the educated and sophisticated public, I fled North, to Sarkoris. There, among the simple people, my talent could finally blossom! I showed them wooden sculptures, whose crude grotesqueness emanated strength and the primordial power of the earth — things they were supposed to understand.\n…so, they beat me up for good measure and kicked me out of their settlement — right after they broke my favorite chisel and spat in my travel bag. Until this day, I have no idea what I did to offend them — by that time, I had already learned not to ask pointless questions.\nThe desperation of it all made me feel bitter and stubborn. But fate challenged me — so I accepted the challenge! I had found my mission — I wanted to create a statue that would INSULT NO ONE. After several weeks of contemplation, I decided to sculpt a chicken. Yes, a simple chicken. What could be offensive about chickens? They are yellow, and they chirp, there's definitely nothing bad about that.\nOh, I couldn't have been more wrong.\nA week after my sculpture was showcased to the audience, a group of grim-looking people came and fell to their knees before it. They pronounced my statue to be an idol of the deity they worshiped — an infernal duke, Iaozrael. It turned out that there is a Duke of Hell whose unholy symbol is... a chicken!\nMore and more cultists came to see my sculpture every day. And then another kind of public arrived — tough knights with long swords, who chopped all the 'admirers of my talent' into pieces. After they were done with the slaughter, they started searching for the person who created 'the blasphemous chicken' — for me!\nI fled, taking my unfortunate creation with me. I dragged the statue as far as I could, and I left it in the wilderness. I hope no one finds it here — although, since you are reading this, my hope was futile.

Clamor and clouds of dust rose up from the caves that night. Once the dust had settled, the miners went down to look, for they were brave people who feared neither darkness nor falling rocks. But what they found was not darkness or a cave-in. What they found was the Pack.\nThe Follower, whose true name had been forgotten generations before, was of clan blood. The Follower was a despicable sorcerer, a degenerate who had turned his back on his ancestors. He had loved the Daughter of the wise clan Patriarch most ardently, but her heart had held no warmth for him. The Follower had stormed into the dark depths of the caves, seething in his resentment, and with much wailing and berating, plotted his revenge. That is where the dread Pack found him, following the scent of profane magic and vice. The Pack devoured him, and in so doing, tasted human blood for the first time, and discovered it was to its liking.\nThe Pack killed the miners who descended into the caves, and thereafter it began venturing up the surface each night to devour one of the villagers before dragging the carcass back to the caves to gnaw on the bones. The wise Patriarch called the clan together in the long house and spoke, then the elders of the clan spoke, then the warriors, and then anyone could say their piece. The ancestors had revealed to the Patriarch that the clan was being punished by the gods for failing to recognize the degenerate sorcerer in their midst, and that no deity would intercede for them now. Lamenting their fate, the clan left their homes, the ancestors' carved images, and their temples to the gods, and fled. That caravan of grief made its way in silence, but not all the clan was represented among its number. Only women, children, and decrepit elders did it contain, for the strong men of the clan had remained behind. Many days they sat in the long house, sharpening their weapons and praying. Each night, one of the men would go down into the caves to satisfy the Pack's hunger with his own flesh. When all the men were dead and the Pack's hunger drove it to the surface, the caravan was already long gone, and the monsters could not pick up their trail.\nThe caravan traveled day and night without rest until it reached the steppe, the very edge of their known world, whence the peaks of their beloved mountains could no longer be seen. And there they settled, living threadbare, meager lives, because they did not know how to rear animals and live the nomadic life that required, and because they had no strong warriors among them. The clan quickly dwindled — the old died, and the young found husbands and wives in other clans and left to join new households. Years later, during one of the harsh steppe winters, the clan Patriarch fell sick and died in the arms of his Daughter, and no one could recall the location of that house where the clan had once resided in such freedom and dignity.\"\nThe final pages of the book have been roughly torn out.",

In the long years that followed, the Kellids of Sarkoris either fled or fell, outmatched, while fighting for their home.\nIn the year 4622, the church of Iomedae announced the beginning of the First Crusade — a blessed war against the demons that had destroyed Sarkoris and now threatened neighboring lands. Valiant warriors, led by Queen Galfrey herself, pushed the Abyssal servants away from their borders and returned home victorious. The year 4630 marked the end of the First Crusade. Numerous fortresses and garrisons were established in those years in former Sarkorian lands — the outposts duty-bound to watch over Mendev's borders.\nAfter eight years, in 4638, the Worldwound suddenly expanded to four times its previous size, unleashing new monstrous hordes. The worst of the blows suffered by the crusaders was the loss of Drezen — a fortress city that used to serve as a base for many a military operation. The Second Crusade was called, which claimed countless lives, yet never resulted in victory. Only with the creation of the Wardstones was the demon invasion stopped, as the lucent Iomedae's magic stood as an impenetrable wall, blocking the invaders' path. In the year 4645, after seven years of arduous and mirthless war, the Second Crusade came to an end.\nThe Third Crusade was declared in 4665, but this time, the crusaders were fighting a war within their own ranks as well. Over the years, many Abyss-serving cultists and spies had found their way past Mendevian defenses. The Third Crusade reached the apex of an inquisition that mercilessly purged heresy and demon worship by fire and sword. The crusade was called off in 4668, after the atrocities of interrogators had provoked sufficient upheaval and discontent among the populace.\nThe Fourth Crusade was instigated by demons in the year 4692, when they broke through the protective barrier of the Wardstones. With righteous fury, the champions of Mendev fought the demons for fifteen years, aiming to put an end to the old threat. But by the conclusion of the Fourth Crusade, which ended in 4707 due to a shortage of supplies and manpower, decisive victory was just as remote a possibility as it had been for all of the previous crusades.\"",

Strange natural phenomena, spontaneously arising ruptures, unique vegetation, and living creatures found neither on Golarion nor in the Abyss, everything is constantly in flux, appearing and disappearing at unpredictable intervals. Through this movement and alteration, if not through its order, one can detect the logical functioning of the organs of a living being.\nThe truth is that, indeed, the Worldwound possesses a semblance of life, and its very structure presupposes a connection to a living soul. This line of reasoning sometimes leads me to... unscientific implications. Namely, if the creation is in essence a reflection of the creator, then can we say that the Worldwound is a reflection of my soul?\nThe Worldwound was created and then improved, and at the same time, a being of duality was cobbled together from the essence of the Abyss and the essence of a mortal soul. Normally, this process requires an essence taken from a creature with strength comparable to that of an empyreal or Abyssal lord, but there are ways to circumvent this requirement. In particular, through the use of the Nahyndrian crystal's rare power.\nIn this section, I refer to this being as the 'Key,' an instrument that allowed me to significantly expand and strengthen my original creation. Due to {mf|his|her} dual nature and connection to the Worldwound, the Key was given the opportunity to obtain amazing powers. However, everything has a price. The Worldwound is linked to the Key, but the Key is also linked to the Worldwound, and carries it in {mf|his|her} soul, like a deadly affliction.\nThis affliction is, indeed, fatal. The duality of the soul grants amazing powers, and primes the soul's owner for Transformation and for the bestowing of incredible abilities. But this duality is also slowly killing the soul's owner. This is a problem I have yet to solve.\"",

For not telling us that the worst fate isn't death. For promising the protection of your 'holy banner', which did not save us from the monsters. For not being with us.\nWhere were you when the squad of Smiling Knights was dying, but did not cry for mercy, but held the pathetic little street leading to the temple? Where were you when our blood filled the gutters, and mixed with the sewage? Where were you when our will and our spirit was broken, beaten, and left sobbing like a wharf wench?\nYour throne is built upon the corpses of naive fools and adventurers hungry for glory. I realized this when the demons brought Commander Verstol into the square and threw him into Sarenrae's healing fount — and then lit a fire beneath it. The Commander was boiled alive for three days, while Sarenrae's once merciful but now cruel blessing prevented him from dying. His skin was covered with blisters and slid off his flesh. We stood in the square and watched, the cold wind torturing our own naked bodies. Our blood flows from our wounds, as if it's trying to flee this horrible place. Deprived of water, our throats crack and bleed. Deprived of food, our stomachs dry out and wither. For three days, the Commander could not die. His meat grew gray and smelled so sweet; I hated myself for wanting to taste it. Commander Verstol stopped screaming by the first midnight. By dawn he could only grunt. On the third morning, this stern man, who had no mercy for himself or his enemies, was crying like a baby. His tears were endless. He was literally cooking in them! Then the fount finally cracked, and he died. The new ruler of Drezen, the demoness Minagho, dined on his flesh. But she was not greedy. Each of us prisoners, tortured with hunger, received a piece of the Commander.\nDo you know what a person cooked alive for three days smells like, Galfrey?\nWriting this pains me greatly. Some terrible insect stung my hand during the battle. Now it has swelled to twice its normal size, and it's the color of raw beef. The skin is about to burst. The heat is melting me, body and soul.

Ha! But there's nothing a smart lad like me can't use to stake out his reputation and make his fortune.\nThere's one particularly nasty sort of demons called abrikandilus. They're made of the souls of vandals and destroyers of art. In demon form, they continue to do the same. When they see beautiful pictures and statues, they fly into a rage and desecrate them.\nI once overheard a conversation on the street between two art collectors. They couldn't decide whether they should patronize a young and promising artist or a famous maestro whose best days were behind him. So I made them an offer: how about we place the two paintings side by side, and I'll summon an abrikandilu. Whichever painting it attacks first would naturally be the more beautiful. The key was to banish the demon in time, before it destroyed the painting — but that wasn't going to be a problem for me!\nThe collectors agreed to run this 'experiment' according to my plan. And thus my legacy began! Three months later, not a single art event could do without me and my demon servant. We were invited to exhibition openings, appraisers' workshops, and auctions. The more the enraged the demon became, on seeing another carving or slapdash daub, the higher its price soared. And they paid me well for my 'appraisal'. I often staged 'artist battles', in which the demon would choose which of two paintings it despised most, and the tickets sold like hot cakes.\nHowever, there was one unfortunate incident. A gnome and an elf came to me from Absalom, two young bright-eyed artists. They wanted to enter one of these battles, but they offered peculiar sculptures instead of paintings. The gnome had a huge pile of nibbled apples preserved by a spell. The elf had a watering can without any holes, which stood on a cart with one square wheel. This, as they explained to me, was 'modern art'. It was, how did they put it... 'unconventive' or some such thing! They claimed it was popular in Absalom, where the gnome and the elf were very famous 'unconventive artists'.\nWell, my job is simple: to display, ahem, their works, gather an audience, and release my demon from its prison. And that's precisely what I did. But the abrikandilu came out of his cage, looked at the apples, and at the watering can with the cart, and then looked at me like I was a complete idiot, turned around, and went back to its cage with an expression of utter disappointment.\nIt was nearly an international scandal. I was so upset that I even returned the money for the appraisal to the gnome and the elf.\nBut it's all right. My business still thrives, even without the Absalom clientele. Meanwhile, where are my 'more talented' fellow apprentices? Half are still crouched over books learning what they can. The other half went off to those ridiculous crusades and perished. They never considered that demons can be used to make money, and a lot of it! I think I'll soon buy myself a little palace. And cover its walls with the works of all the most famous artists, ha!\"",

Instead, they might ask their neighbors for some wood, traditionally voicing their request in the form of concern: they need something to 'warm the witch's feet.' On the appointed day, the crowd places the effigy on a pole in the center of the settlement or neighborhood, where everyone can throw mud at it until sunset. At nightfall, cheers erupt as Areelu Vorlesh's effigy burns to ash. It's worth noting that effigy incineration is so akin to an atrocious method of execution that guards and other enforcers often observe these festivities with great suspicion. However, any claims of the Sarkorians burning those suspected of demon worship in the place of an effigy are idle flights of fancy, lacking substance.\"",

By joining the crusader ranks, I've truly found my place for the very first time, can you imagine?\nI can already hear your disapproving retort: 'Berenguer, that scoundrel, he now thinks himself a hero!'

I joined the crusaders out of boredom, out of horrible melancholy that clouded my mind and filled it with dark thoughts. But for some reason, a slacker and a drunk such as I, who has done nothing worthwhile in his whole life — happened to gain the favor of the resplendent Iomedae. On the fifteenth day of battle, surrounded by her loyal devotees, stained up to my elbows in demon blood, I gave in to my comrades' influence and offered a prayer to the Inheritor — and my prayers were answered! From that day onward, I was not just a crusader — I was a paladin of Iomedae, able to smite Abyssal monsters with the power lent to me by the divine.\nWill you even recognize me, Shynn, should I return home? I've changed, I can feel it myself. Iomedae gave my life purpose, offered me a weapon to slay the enemies of Golarion. By the Inheritor's name, I won't betray her trust!\nPlease, send my heartfelt regards to our poor mother and show her this letter.

    "6cbff170-fdb2-4a82-b6b3-c4ef0f45b9f4": "\"The Newfound Sanctuary was a beacon of faith for anyone who found themselves lost in these grim lands. Crusaders, merchants, travelers, and common people were all welcome there for a prayer to any god who would listen to them, for a night's rest and a safe haven if needed.\nPerhaps this is why the demons attacked the Newfound Sanctuary the way they did. The sun didn't rise that morning. We hadn't known what was going on until it was too late: a cloud of filthy dark smoke engulfed the fortress. We couldn't see, we couldn't breathe. A famous mage named Zacharius was the fortress warden at that time; he understood that it was the beginning of an onslaught and sounded the alarm. Then the fire came. The arcane fire rained down from the sky, the fire that stuck to any surface it touched, the fire that no amount of water would put down. And finally the scream went up. It was the sound of a thousand howling demons coming for our souls. The gates of the fortress fell immediately, but the crusaders did not. Their bodies proved stronger than wood and iron: the demon army's front edge got stuck in the living wall they created, and they bought us some time with their own lives. Zacharius himself left his quarters to fight alongside the rest. His spells struck down the giants who were slinging balls of fire at us, one after another, and for a few minutes we thought that there was still hope.\nIt was their unholy word that ruined it all. An especially tall and disgusting demon stepped out of their army's ranks. He carried an enormous bronze horn fully covered with faces — fleshy human faces, still alive and screaming — that they had cut off and put on this horrendous thing. The demon raised the horn to his mouth and blew; the faces wailed in unison. He kept blowing until his chest split, splaying his ribs out wide — and the horn cracked, too, unable to withstand such cursed power. His task was complete, though: an unbearable wave of horrific sound engulfed us, and not a single person could stand tall and keep their conscience when they heard it. The unholy word left the Newfound Sanctuary empty and littered with bodies.\nThe demons cried and rushed in, but that was a mistake they'd regret very soon. Yes, we were wounded, terrified, injured, and deafened… But we weren't broken yet. We waited for them to pour into the inner yard and jumped back to our feet! We feigned death until they turned their backs on us, and then we attacked! We killed them and fell back to lie among our fallen brothers and sisters, playing out another act of this dreadful stage show! We built barricades from the dead bodies of our fellows in arms and used them to strike the enemies down unseen! We took the demons by the throat, bent their spiked backs, and drowned them in our own blood.\nEventually the screams of the invaders whom we resisted died down. The Newfound Sanctuary chewed up and swallowed everyone stupid enough to enter it, and the remaining demons stood still, paralyzed with fear. Even these creatures can know fear.\nThat was the moment when Commander Zacharius led us to breach the siege. We went out… No, we ran. We ran for our lives like we had wings. We, with our thousands of wounds, covered the distance between the fortress and the demon army so fast that their lord wasn't able to finish his unholy prayers! We broke through their ranks, killing anyone we saw until they split and stepped aside, in terror of our battle spirit. There truly was something to protect and die for: the priests of all the gods of the Newfound Sanctuary were in the middle of our formation, marching in step with the youngest and strongest soldiers. Their backs cracked under the weight of their relics, their faces were petrified with pain — yet they still had enough faith in their souls to keep smiling, to inspire us, to heal and bless those who came close to them. They were scared to death, but they kept on going. We were all scared, and we all kept on going.\nAnd we made it. We cut our way through the demon army and went out into the open. Only then did we face our fear and let it drive us forward and away from our enemies like the wind driving a ship out to sea. We disappeared in the mountain shade. We hid in the canyons. We survived.\nAfter all these years I still remember seeing Zacharius and his apprentices for the last time. They were leading our formation. When they had broken through the demon army, they split and formed a passage, holding the enemies off for us to escape that deadliest of traps. Still, even their power had its limits. The ring of demons tightened and closed in, cutting them off from the rest of our group. The last thing I remember is Zacharius gathering his followers and retreating back to the Newfound Sanctuary — now condemned to be called the Lost Chapel.\"",

The order in which the caravan's signs are arranged holds both metaphorical and deeply mystical meaning, in light of which astrologists advise against the use of models where the signs appear out of order, or even in reverse order, as in some cases.\nThe Thrush (18 Kuthona — 20 Abadius) is the sign associated with friendship, hospitality, a promise of new beginnings, and song. The constellation portrays a songbird sitting on a branch and greeting the weary Cosmic Caravan at the start of the new year. The Thrush is the patron of merry makers and optimists.\nThe Lantern Bearer (21 Abadius — 16 Calistril) is the constellation that begins the caravan's procession. The Lantern Bearer goes forth, chasing back winter's darkness and lighting the Cosmic Caravan's way. This sign is disposed toward cheerful, self-sacrificing, and altruistic personalities.\nThe Newlyweds (17 Calistril — 11 Pharast) depicts a young husband and wife whose appearance heralds the beginning of spring. The Newlyweds boldly lead the Cosmic Caravan, for they are guarded by love and youth. This sign favors those who possess a passionate or romantic nature.\nThe Bridge (12 Pharast — 18 Gozran) is the constellation that symbolizes change. The Bridge soars over tempestuous waters and links one snowy, cold shore with another where spring has already arrived and green shoots are already stretching skyward. This is the sign of obstinate, tenacious personalities who do not fear the dark and cold.\nThe Daughter (19 Gozran — 13 Desnus) is a young girl who signifies the pure joy and enthusiasm that spring days bring. The Daughter smiles on matters related to merriment, solace, and celebrating holidays.\nThe Rider (14 Desnus — 20 Sarenith) is the mounted warrior who guards the Cosmic Caravan. It is a combative and contradictory sign that favors both valiant defenders and rash, bloodthirsty bandits. The arrival of the Rider marks the beginning of summer's heat.\nThe Patriarch (21 Sarenith — 20 Erastus) is the wise and ancient father of the Cosmic Caravan, who knows its route and sets the course of its journey. This constellation symbolizes wisdom and experience, and favors judicious and sagacious natures.\nThe Wagon (21 Erastus — 10 Arodus) — the heavily loaded and foundational Wagon is what gives the Cosmic Caravan its name. It is associated with the spirit of enterprise, diligence, and, of course, swiftness. Personalities drawn to travel and selfless service will find succor under this sign.\nThe Pack (11 Arodus — 16 Rova) is a group of beasts that trail the Cosmic Caravan and feed off its bounty. Some sages believe that the Pack consists of wild dogs that have been tamed by the caravan's travelers, and that therefore the Pack represents family ties, affinity with nature, and mastery over fauna. Others argue that the Pack is a swarm of vermin, feasting on the leavings of the Cosmic Caravan and greedily coveting the travelers' cooking pots. In this interpretation, the sign takes on a darker, more predatory aspect.\nThe Mother (17 Rova — 30 Lamashan) — the caring and gentle Mother dominates the sky when it is time to bring in the rich harvest. Her tender hands hold on to summer's warmth and promise protection against winter's harsh breath. Many scholars agree that the Mother also fulfills the role of spiritual guide for the Cosmic Caravan, and therefore they ascribe to her patronage those who are of a spiritual or nurturing disposition.\nThe Stargazer (31 Lamashan — 20 Neth) — bringing up the rear, the Stargazer completes the caravan's procession. A wistful dreamer, the Stargazer is patron to those of a similar nature — aloof, perspicacious in matters important but far-removed, yet absent-minded and inept in daily life. It is unsurprising that many scholars possess an affinity for this sign.\nThe Stranger (21 Neth — 29 Neth) is an enigmatic and foreboding sign that reigns in the night sky for little more than a week. A solitary traveler who follows the Cosmic Caravan at a distance, the Stranger reveals nothing as to its intent. The Stranger is an outsider, a wayfarer, and many personalities disposed to a life of wandering fall under the patronage of this sign. The Stranger is a sign of contradictions — some see it as the patron of all adventurers, while others interpret the sign as the grim harbinger of the constellation that follows it.\nThe Follower (30 Neth — 17 Kuthona) is the dark figure that pursues the Cosmic Caravan. A disciple of dark forces who is associated with death and darkness, the Follower waxes in power at winter's peak. There are various interpretations of this sign. According to some, the Follower is an exile, cursed and banished from the caravan. Others see the Follower as a fearsome enemy, and it is flight from this foe that forces the Cosmic Caravan on its perpetual journey. Still others claim that this sign represents death itself. Predictably, those of a darker disposition who possess an affinity for death fall under the auspices of the Follower.\"",
    "4c733cec-89cf-4e48-9deb-a81acbe39a61": "\"The demon lords whose names are known to mortals number no more than a few dozen. Far more numerous are those who aspire to that rank and their own Abyssal realm, but who as yet are unable to make a bid for such power. There are hundreds, possibly thousands, of such demons, but their names are known only to experienced demonologists, and to those unhappy fools who decide to sell their souls to the Abyss and fail even to find a worthy patron for their trouble. Time and time again, one of these weaker demons will secure a resounding victory, scale the heights (or should that be 'sink to the depths'?) of the demon hierarchy, already fancying themselves a demon lord, when they soon make a misstep and die an inglorious death. The fate of such a demon could serve as a lesson to the rest — but if demons possessed the capacity to learn from their own (or others') mistakes, would they even be demons? No. A stubborn refusal to learn is one of the major flaws that distinguish the bedlam of the Abyss from the well-ordered hierarchy of Hell.\nThe demoness Izyagna, She of the Sevenfold Swarm, serves as an example of such a fall from (dis)grace. One of the many daughters of Lamashtu, she possessed seven bodies — seven mortal women of the various races of Golarion, each with an ant's head, controlled by one hive mind. She commanded various insects — swarming, crawling creatures, with ants her especial preference. The author of these words witnessed the oath of obedience sworn by cultists of Izyagna with his own eyes — the witless initiate was forced to meditate while sitting atop an anthill! However, the human sacrifices being carried out by this fool's brethren around the little town I was serving in at the time were far from amusing — it required no small effort to destroy the cultists, who had been summoning ravenous swarms and spreading madness in the name of their mistress.\nSo what became of her? What fate befell Izyagna? The particulars are unknown, but consensus holds that the mistress of the crawling swarm ran afoul of the master of the flying swarm, the far more powerful demon lord Deskari. Only Lamashtu's intercession saved her daughter from death — but not from abasement and the loss of her powers. Consequently, most of her followers forsook for the cult of the Mother of Beasts. Today Izyagna is worshiped by a handful of individuals who possess a stubborn predilection for sitting on anthills — and even to them she can grant only minor spells.\"",

But something tells me they taste exactly the same.'\nI remain silent and don't move. I couldn't if I tried. One of my hands is pinned to the wide armrest, with a knife thrust to the hilt.

It's not because we want to win a war and conquer your world. Perhaps our lords want this, but trust me, they are as far removed from their subjects as your lords and kings are from you. No, we come for those like you. For the persistent and the proud, who won't break until the end. For those whose suffering is sweet and lasts and lasts.

In my current straitened circumstances, my only diversion lies in scientific endeavor and exercising my mental faculties.\nCreating witless undead from crude components is the preserve of ignoramuses incapable of conceiving an original thought. With the application of even the barest effort and magic, any necromancer can unlock the true potential of our art. By availing oneself of the school of transmutation, several incomplete bodies can be turned into a single construct that markedly improves upon the capabilities of the raw material. However, even the most ambitious mages pursuing the path of necromancy rarely decide to take that final step and transform themselves in the same fashion as their own creations.\nWhy? What drives such powerful revulsion to undeath among those whose life is criminally short? Perhaps the reason is fear of the gods, whose will these mages violate when they dare to meddle in the supreme order of things. Perhaps the instinctive disgust that arises when encountering eternal travelers in death is caused by the decay and desiccation of the corporeal sheath. Perhaps it is sentimental attachments that weaken the resolve.\nNot every mortal is capable of ascending to lichdom. Each one of us who has attained such a state has traveled an entirely distinct path from that of our peers, but we were united by one and the same goal, to which we drew nearer with all the inevitability of a knife hurtling toward a heart.

Sadly, Sarkorian cheeses, made from the milk of both cows and mares, can only be found in the stories of the past — and deep in the cellars of the wealthiest collectors. The destruction of this great civilization of outstanding craftsmen was a blow to Golarian culture, but this book only covers the legacy of its cheesemakers. Crumbly white bryndza used to be served at the table of just about every Sarkorian household, but hard cheeses were also prized highly. A single lump of cheese, covered in bluish-green mold, and bearing the brand of the Windstep clan (a mare galloping beneath the stars) was worth no less than a thousand coins. Now, however, a true cheese connoisseur will tell you that its price is measured in the tens of thousands. Those who have had the pleasure of tasting Sarkorian cheese say that it is an experience like no other. When you eat this cheese, it feels as though you have traveled to the vast expanses of Sarkoris yourself.\nAnyone who has the good fortune of acquiring some of the cheese made by Reudger the White of the Windstep clan will truly be transported to old Sarkoris with every bite.\"",

Only just and wise rulers would be deemed worthy of receiving these high rewards.\nA metamorphosis, however, turned the seven virtues into seven sins.

Old, leery, and cunning, the beast satisfied its thirst for blood by destroying anyone who tried to kill it, and there was never a shortage of such brave yet foolish souls. While the small tribe of mountain giants worshiped the ancient gowrow, the Sarkorian tribes considered Chillroar a grim threat, encouraging the best of their warriors to try and defeat it in a feat of strength which would be remembered for ages to come. Despite those heroes' valiant efforts, Chillroar managed to outlive its enemies: Sarkoris fell to the demonic onslaught. The creature's triumph did not last long, however. The opening of the Worldwound had changed the local landscape forever, draining many rivers dry and wrecking the gowrow's lair.

The loss of Aroden was still a raw wound in the hearts of the faithful, and those who answered the call of the Church of Iomedae channeled their grief and fury toward a new cause — the defense of Mendev and the liberation of Kellid lands from the spawn of the Abyss who at that time were reveling in the ruins of Sarkoris.\nMany answered the call of the Inheritor's followers and fought under the banners of the crusaders. Illustrious warriors ventured forth into the lands captured by the demon pestilence, bringing with them cleansing fire and long-absent hope. Ere long the filthy hordes were driven out of the western reaches of Mendev into the Sarkorian Steppe, and beyond as far as the Threshold fortress, which to this day remains the beating heart of the Worldwound. In 4630, having pursued the demons beyond the Northmounds of Sarkoris and secured the borders, the Church of Iomedae declared the First Crusade complete.\nBut alas, what the valiant liberators thought was the closing chapter to a victorious campaign was but the prelude to a tragedy that is unfolding today before our very eyes. Two years ago, an endless wave of demons poured forth from the Northmounds into the Kellids' plains. The fortresses that had so recently stood strong on Mendev's borders were washed away in this unstoppable flood. The Second Crusade was called up without delay, but it was too late: the source of the corruption, the Worldwound, opened its putrid maw wider to disgorge not scattered hordes, but full-fledged armies led by monstrous generals.\nThe Second Crusade goes on, but the morale of Golarion's defenders is at its lowest ebb. Neither the Church of Iomedae nor the courageous crusaders have the power to overcome the demons that have now overrun Sarkoris. There will be no turning point in this war: all we can do now is wait for death on the borders of Mendev, which has not yet bowed down before the hordes of the Abyss, and pray to the gods that the Worldwound does not expand yet again, delivering new horrors into our world.\"",

This is what happened. Ogar the farmer died, leaving three sons. The two older ones divided the land and lived their lives, and Genty, the youngest one, was a square peg in a round hole, as they say; he only knew how to bask under a tree and eat pies. What was he to do? Where could he apply himself? So he got a rusty old sword from the blacksmith's back yard, mounted his skinny horse, and rode off, over the hills and far away.\nSooner or later, he came to a castle. Inside it, there was a knight's wife, sitting around waiting for her husband to return from the crusades. So our Genty sat down next to her, saying, 'Fair Lady, your husband is a great man, and you deserve all compassion. I am a crusader myself, and used to fight the horrible spawn of the Worldwound...' and so on he rambled. He sat behind the stone walls for a month, gained ten pounds, became even more well-groomed, and in the end looked like a baron! But he grew bored of the knight's wife: she was always pale and sad, and cried for days, praying to Sarenrae. So Genty waved her goodbye and went on his way.\nHe rode and rode, and saw a mill on a river, and a miller's wife — rosy cheeks, plump as a partridge. Our Genty cozied up to her, saying, 'Lady miller's wife, does your husband happen to be at home?'\n'No, my good sir, last year the fey dragged him into the river,' she said.\nSo Genty invited himself to stay at the mill. He lay on a soft bed, eating pies, drinking beer, and walking around the village. He had some nerve: told everyone at the village tavern what a seasoned crusader he was. He feared no demon, and promised to show them what's what!\nSo one moonlit night, when he was huffing and puffing on the widow, he felt her grabbing his back so strongly that he couldn't stand it. He looked down, and there she was... a crone, horrible, like a skeleton, with a crooked nose, eyes like embers, a hollow stomach, ribs sticking out, and claws instead of nails, stinking of a ripened grave. Try as he might, Genty couldn't get away. The crone held him tight, hissing, 'Where are you going, my sweet crusader. Come on, put your bun in my oven!' And she stuck out her long tongue, and licked her rotten teeth.\nSomehow Genty wiggled away, leaving plenty of his skin and meat on her claws. He ran from the mill in a panic! Ran all the way to the village, naked and bleeding. So, he's running and yelling, 'Demons! Demons!' Well, the locals gathered with their axes and pitchforks, and came to the mill — but it was empty. The crone was gone. They did find an ugly corpse in the basement, though. They knew it was the miller's wife, by her hair and clothes. That's when Genty lost his mind. Now he sits under his brother's windows, staring into the distance, saying, 'The demons are coming, the demons are coming.' That's the only thing he'll say.\"",

The rich mineral deposits of these lands had been known to the Kellids since ancient times, and over the long centuries, plenty of mines and workshops had sprung up here, and their output flowed into Iz. From here, traders led their heavily loaded caravans to other parts of Sarkoris and beyond.\nMany a wonder crafted by the Kellids over the years of their capital's prosperity disappeared without a trace with the demonic invasion and Iz's destruction. Local artisans were most skillful in their trade, which can be seen through the few surviving works of weapon smithing, jewelry making, and metal casting arts. And while silver headdresses with ornate temple rings and lightweight sabers with hilts bearing their owners' initials can still be found in museums and private collections, other handcrafted examples of Iz's legacy are lost forever. Specifically, we, of course, only know of architectural landmarks of both secular and sacred variety through scarce descriptions. Meanwhile, local stonecutters were recognized throughout all Sarkoris, as many palaces, temples and monuments decorating other cities were made by the hands of artisans from Iz...\"",

If tomorrow the ground trembles, splits apart, and devours this cursed city, I will not shed one tear. No one here, not a single soul, deserves any compassion. Everyone who lives in this city is a criminal! If there were any justice in this world, every one of them would be hanging from the gallows, Prelate Hulrun and Queen Galfrey chief among them!\nAsk anyone on the streets what they know of mongrels. The answer will be dumb silence, or the lowered eyes of a scoundrel who knows their crimes but doesn't want to think about it. 'Mongrels!' A disgusting nickname, which the residents of the city have given to the brave crusader heroes who defeated the forces of evil, but paid for it with their health. Covered with scabs and tumors, bloated and gnarled, they were no longer beautiful enough to be tolerated by the very people they'd saved. As a reward for their heroism, the city dwellers exiled them to the sewers and damp caves beneath the city! The author of these words went down there and spoke with them — and I'll have you know that the ugliest of them is more noble than all the paladins of Mendev, not to mention that head-chopping Prelate and his murderous Queen!\nAnd if any pretend that today's city dwellers aren't responsible for the crime of their grandfathers, then I will spit in their face, for the grandchildren of the exiled are still down there, crawling in the mud and eating garbage. And everyone who knows about this and does nothing, and everyone who should know but prefers blissful ignorance — I say they're all guilty and they repeat the same crime every day!\nAnd as long as this doesn't change, any citizen who desires to fight a demon should take a knife and stab themselves in the stomach. For your city has already rotted, and you are no better than the demons! And if anyone would repent and right this terrible wrong, they should turn their weapons on the prudish paladins who preach good but defend an order that flies in the face of justice!\nDOWN WITH THE PALADINS! DOWN WITH PRELATE HULRUN! DOWN WITH QUEEN GALFREY!\"",

What evil has struck you silent and forced you to turn your back on those of us sworn to you? Are you still alive? Answer us, Last Azlanti, I beseech you. Answer me, Aroden! I need you now more than ever!'\nMy cheeks are inflamed with resentment. He doesn't answer our prayers. All of us, his devoted paladins, feel the great absence of our patron's disappearance. His grace over us has faded, and we have been orphaned. Why, then, do I not grieve, but instead feel like a rejected daughter?\nI kneel in front of the altar in the tiny house's chapel and pray. No one dares to disturb me, but they don't know that it is not devout faith that keeps me here, but fear. I'm afraid to go outside. A duty I am not prepared to face awaits me there. A war is waiting.\nI have never been in a real war before, unlike my father. His armor, which has seen many battles, lies near the altar on a stone slab bearing his name. The gold buckle on his belt gleams with the symbol of Aroden stamped on it. I remember it shining much brighter in the past, this relic of our lost god...\nEveryone expects me to go into battle, clad in my father's armor, as a true daughter of my lineage. I must not dishonor my family. I must smite my enemies with my family's motto as my battle cry, but I'm... scared. What happens if I fail? If I hesitate or show fear? If I let everyone down? I'll be a disgrace, the stupid girl who ruined everything! Aroden, how I miss your grace...\nFootsteps echo behind me. Who dares to violate my privacy? Why now, when my wretched, treacherous heart could falter at any moment? A warrior stands behind me — not young or old, just an ordinary knight in a simple breastplate. She looks me straight in the eye, without impertinence, but also without adulation.\n'You will not disgrace your father.'\nAt first I think I misheard her. The warrior's words sounded like an answer to my unspoken thoughts. How odd! Or...\n'You will not falter. I see you standing firm. So leave your fear behind.'\nWho is she? How does she read the worries written on my heart? And how dare she do so without permission! I prepare an angry rebuke, but the words die on my lips, and only a pitiful complaint comes out instead: 'Aroden left us...'\nStupid me! Why are you squeaking like a mouse? What an embarrassment you are! You must... The warrior drops down to one knee before me so that our eyes are level. There is strength in her calm, determined face.\n'Yes, he left us. But that doesn't mean we're alone. I will support you in this battle. No matter how arduous, no matter how dark the skies, no matter how much blood flows from my wounds, I shall stand with you. We shall fight for our loved ones and our friends, for the right to live and die free. We shall do everything we possibly can, and after that, we shall begin to do the impossible. And if the hour should come when our arms can no longer raise our swords, our bodies will become a shield to cover those who still have strength to fight. I, Iomedae, Inheritor of Aroden, swear this to you. This is my vow.'\nHer hand rests on my father's armor, and light emanates from it. It envelops the armor and soaks into it, blinding me. My eyes fill with tears — I never thought I'd cry of happiness again. When I wipe my eyes clear, I find myself alone. The gold buckle on my father's military belt shines like the sun again. The symbol inscribed on it is different now — it now shows a knight's sword exuding light.\nThat is my symbol, from now until forever.\n{br}Can we truly prevail? Yes! We, the knights of Mendev, march forward in a splendid, gleaming formation to the stronghold of the damned enemy. City of Iz, today you will fall! The horde of demons and their lackeys scurry away from us, and I smile as I lower the visor of the helmet my father once wore. I haven't disgraced you! None of us have.\nA shadowy female figure approaches us. Her cloak obscures her face, but we all know who she is: the Betrayer of Humanity! Her hands dance, weaving spells, and we raise our shields, preparing for her crushing blow... but we're still not ready.\nGiant invisible scythes begin to shred our ranks. They easily cut through flesh and steel, stir up dust, and halt our offensive, which ceases to exist. In an instant, the Betrayer destroys our unit, and I... I see dust whirl up in front of me, then a blow of monstrous force knocks me off my horse.\nDarkness envelops me. Or is it death? No, I feel someone's hands. Someone helps me up, removing my crumpled helmet. How am I still alive? I lower my eyes and see a horrible gash across my breastplate. The gold buckle with Iomedae's symbol shattered, but warded off the fatal blow of the damn witch.\nI look around in horror — there is no army anymore. Our ranks are broken, all courage has left our soldiers. Screams ring out everywhere, but alas, many more mouths are silent. The Betrayer watches us, making no attempt to finish us off. I can't see her face, but I can swear there is nothing but boredom and indifference written all over it.\nGrabbing the shoulder of a sergeant running by, I shout in his face, 'Rally the troops! Those who can fight — get to the front row to cover the others! We don't retreat until we've carried away the wounded!'\nHis eyes are full of wild, mad fear. He forces out an objection: 'The war is lost... We are... doomed... Run... ' I hold him firm, looking into his eyes. He's scared... I understand.\n'Stand firm, warrior. The battle is lost, but our war has just begun. No matter how arduous, no matter how dark the skies, no matter how much blood flows from my wounds, I shall stand with you. We shall fight for our loved ones and our friends, for the right to live and die free. We shall do everything we possibly can, and after that, we shall begin to do the impossible. And if the hour should come when our arms can no longer raise our swords, our bodies will become a shield to cover those who still have strength to fight.

He is looking for signs of my presence, but the gloom conceals me.\nMy dastardly snake is after my newest jewel — an old, gnarled tree I took in a raid on Elysium. The ruby fruits that decorate its branches grant three precious pieces of knowledge to the one who tastes them. A great treasure, which my little thief wants to take for himself. His scaled hand picks one of the fruits and brings it to his smirking lips. He grins smugly before clenching his claws, squashing the juicy, priceless flesh. In an arrogant show of wastefulness, he destroys my treasure, disdaining to taste it! The peel of the fruit tears, revealing beneath it... teeth! Thousands of tiny, needle-sharp teeth sink into my thief's palm.\nWith a surprised hiss, he tosses the fruit aside, but the others, spreading wide their greedy maws and jointed legs, swarm him like angry, hungry fleas. I cackle in triumph and step out of the gloom. For the first time, I have managed to outsmart my little thief, who is so very clever, but not omniscient. It took great finesse to make the tree drink of the poisons of the Abyss and turn it into such an elaborate trap. Yes, the precious wisdom it held is ruined beyond hope, but this victory is a far superior treasure.\nMy thief hisses in agony and paints the floors with his blood, but even now his face bears a fiendish grin.\n'That was a clever trick you pulled on me. I feel like a complete fool!' His hissing is full of mischievous joy, and my triumph gives way to bafflement. 'You amused me greatly today — you have Star Rattle's respect for that. Until next time!' My thief vanishes into thin air, and I let out a wounded roar at his departure. I wished to see his suffering, his fear, his bitterness in defeat! But instead, that... that protean with a foolish name — he was pleased? He has stolen the sweetness of victory from me — once again!\"",

My carefully prepared trap has snapped shut.\n'Have you missed me, my dear?'\nThe angel turns away, avoiding my gaze. Unconquered, pure, sublime. Time has distorted her image in my mind's eye, and now I am absorbing it again, relishing her every feature.\n'Now you will stay with me for eternity.' I clasp a small lock-shaped pendant around her wrist and hang the key around my neck. 'And here is my first gift to you. You cannot remove this pendant, or leave the Abyss, or send word to the Upper Planes. Now you are dead to everyone, but do not fret. I will give you all that you wish. You will enjoy being mine.'\n'You don't have to do this,' she whispers without looking up.\nI freeze in confusion. Of course I don't have to do this. But why wouldn't I?\"",

And that's not all — a particularly pestilent individual among them nagged me for so long that I deigned to pay him a personal visit. At first my intention was to squash him like an annoying fly, but he had prepared such exuberant offerings and such skillful flattery that I ended up sparing him — even naming him my Archpriest.\nStrange. No one had ever looked at me the way he did. I am used to servants and prisoners gazing at me with hatred, with fear, with the dull docility of a crushed spirit. But what I saw in that mortal's eyes was fascination. Adoration. Awe. It is certainly gratifying, yet also concerning. Is it wise to let a servant retain free will, even though his only current desire is to serve you? Goodwill is a flimsy collar. The whole point of shackles is that the one wearing them does not get to choose when they are put on or removed. What good is a servant who can simply change his mind?\"",

I take no offense, I drink in the sight of her. I am admiring her pristine beauty, which I, like a diligent gemcutter, have perfected by dressing her in the finest gowns, by adorning her with the finest jewelry.\n'You don't have to be like this,' she whispers.\nAfraid of ruining the sublimity of her image, I gently touch her hair. I suddenly realize that I still do not know her name.\n'I am going to call you my songbird. You brighten my palace, but your songs are repetitive. As the trills of all birds are wont to be. Such is your nature.'\nShe jerks her chin up, her gaze fixing on me. Her eyes are so beautiful. So rarely does she raise them to look at me like that, directly.\n'I don't need your gifts, Nahyndri!' She tears the diadem from her head and throws it. The precious metal bends, the diamonds scatter on the floor. 'Hear my words, I beg of you!

The melodious jingling heralds that Star Rattle, my devious little protean thief, craves new spoils.

Hecatrix was the queen of courtesans and the most beautiful of women. Her heart-winning power was so great that even kings and queens could not harm her — the cruelest assassins would prostrate themselves at her feet like loyal hounds. Impressed by her beauty and sensuality, the goddesses Shelyn and Calistria decided she should be their priestess and quarreled ferociously over her. Shrewd Hecatrix never was a chooser. She always wanted it all, so she praised each goddess in secret when her rival was not present. She was collecting all the blessings of Shelyn and Calistria in a beautiful gem until one night the truth about her deception was revealed. Both goddesses were enraged by her betrayal, and while the kind Shelyn forgave the traitress, Calistria decided to destroy her. In the course of an unbridled wine-fueled nocturnal orgy of debauchery, the queen of the courtesans was torn to pieces by a crowd driven mad with lust.\nNo one paid any heed to Hecatrix for two hundred years until one day the sin-soaked soul of a succubus with a magnificent scarlet gemstone on her bosom awakened in the Abyss. The gemstone was called the Attractive Impulse. The gem combined the passion and lust of the queen of courtesans with the blessings of two goddesses, which together forged a dangerous and alluring relic.",

A mortal heretic and twice renegade finally put a halt to the first retriever's murderous servitude. The Templar of the Ivory Labyrinth, whose name is unknown, repented of his deeds and left the cult.

Later, the demons discovered the retriever's remains and cobweb and turned them into an altar. The retriever's ravenous hunger seeped into the altar.

'I see no way out. The goddess has forsaken us!'\nHilor took his eyes off the priestess for a moment to glance around. That was all the demon worshiper needed to spew out a curse, jump up, and lunge at him with her corrupted dagger, aiming for his chest. Hilor parried the strike and immediately countered, but the flashing steel barely left a scratch on the enemy's thigh.\nThe temple around them was burning. The other cultists had long since fled, driven by fear, but Hilor and the sorceress's last escape route had been cut off by the possessed priestess. The venture-captain waved his hand, clearing the smoke in front of him, and saw their path to salvation.\n'The aqueduct!' barked Hilor. 'Right above us!'\nStill smearing tears and soot all over her face between sobs, the elf raised her head. Closed troughs ran at ceiling level — mountain river branches that supplied the putrescent gardens of Cyth-V'sug with life-giving moisture.\n'We have to puncture it!'\nThe elven sorceress only hesitated for a moment, then threw up her hands, still dangling bits of rope from them. A magical surge cut through the smoke and sunk into the stone, leaving behind a glowing trail. At first, the water spattered out only in a thin stream, and Hilor thought their plan had failed. But a moment later, the stonework gave, and clear, roaring waters rushed from the rupture, sweeping away the smoldering rafters, pieces of roofing, and the shrieking, horrified priestess.\nChased by the wild torrent, Hilor took cover behind the altar, after pushing the elf to safety first.\n'We're down two problems and up one. We won't be sacrificed, and it's unlikely that we'll burn alive,' — mused the venture-captain, sheathing his sword. 'Now we just need to figure out how to avoid drowning.'\nThe elven sorceress looked at the rapidly rising water. Her lips quivered.\n'The goddess has forsaken us. There is no hope.'\"",

His heart threatened to beat right out of his chest, but his mind was consumed with the feverish awareness of how close he was to his target. Only a few dozen paces separated him from the Spinner of Nightmares — close enough to shoot, but the venture-captain wanted to be sure the bolt wouldn't kill her, merely maim and immobilize her. The hand crossbow that Hilor concealed under the folds of his cloak was throwing off his balance.\n'The jig's up, the Spinner of Nightmares.'

Hilor let out a bellow, pouring all his hatred and despair into the shout, dashed forward, and, slipping on the roof, tumbled to his knees.

No bubbling mold on the ground, no trees that are identical down to the last leaf, no trace of demons whatsoever.'\nThe ranger answered after a long pause.\n'I don't know for sure, Captain. But people have different theories. Some say that the Needleglens are cursed by forces that came to this world before the demons — horrible creatures that could addle your mind with a single look. People say that's why the demons avoid this place — they're afraid.'\nHilor scoffed. His guide's tale was surely nothing but a cock-and-bull story, but the idea — of his quarry hiding at the very heart of a place thought to pose a dire threat to her — well, he couldn't help being tickled by that. The Spinner of Nightmares's trail led here, to this strange wood, there was no doubt about that. But how did she ever find the way here?\nHilor fished his tracker's monocle out from the depths of his pack, clipped it on his nose, looked up — and let out a full-bellied laugh.\n'I can't fault the harridan for her ingenuity, but she might've changed up her nasty tricks, knowing the arsenal I carry.

The forest remained as much a mystery to him as before, but Hilor's gaze, directed as it was through the Eye of Truth, effortlessly picked out the magical notches on the tree trunks, leading to an as yet unknown destination.\"",

This didn't surprise them in the slightest. They'd had the same dish for dinner for a week. The hospital's residents used to be lucky enough to get potatoes and even turnips sometimes. But about a month ago, the knights of the order of the Thrice Holy Shining Sun and Dissipating Darkness Scimitar of Our Beloved Goddess Sarenrae accidentally shot a catapult the wrong direction, and annihilated the cart of the farmer who supplied the hospital with these vegetal delicacies. Ever since, the wounded only had cabbage soup for dinner, occasionally with a bit of protein when the odd cockroach crawled into the pot.\nAfter enjoying their delightful meal, the wounded stuffed their smoking pipes with something which rather more resembled hay than tobacco. Their bad habits demanded the inhalation of some smoke or other after mealtime, but with these practical matters happily resolved, they fell to talking.\n'Which demon you think is the most dangerous?' asked Wuzlich the Spearman, scratching the stub of his leg with the stub of his arm. 'I think it's abrikandilus. Those monsters are cunning and sneaky, almost like Varisians. And their teeth are even sharper! Look!' He illustrated his point for his comrades by holding up his remaining fingers — two and a half of them.\n'It depends the way you look at it,' answered Greglie the Artillerist, though she could hardly look at it at all: her eyes were covered with bandages. 'Your abrikandilus are easy pickings. But balors are a different thing! He hits you with his whip, and your eyes pop out!'\nShe waved her pipe energetically, casting its contents into Wuzlich's face. While the latter was coughing and brushing himself off, Briggie joined the conversation.\n'Baloors and brikandilus are all right, I suppose, but I'd say there isn't a demon in the world scarier than a regular louse. Of course, the other demons can teleport places, but the louse doesn't even need to do that! Wherever you look, it's already there!' Then he stuck his hand under his shirt, pulled out the subject of his speech from somewhere in his armpit, and demonstrated it to his friends. 'You can run away from a big demon with a whip, but who can run away from lice? They sting everyone, from the foot-soldier to the general. Even the Queen herself isn't immune. Now you might say it doesn't do much harm. — After all, how much blood can one louse drink? But I'm telling you, think how much soldier's blood they've drunk all together. It's got to be a whole sea, wouldn't you think? More than all the demons in the Abyss! And if anyone tells me a louse isn't a demon, then ha-ha to them! Could a monster like that come from anywhere besides the Abyss?'\"",

The priests of Gorum, who come to the prayer in armor covered with blood, make no attempt to conceal their disdain for those such as me, who are not rushing to the front lines of the battle... But what can I do if my weak, soft hands have been taught gentleness, not violence? I catch a glance of a priestess of Shelyn — squeamish, compassionate surely, and full of prim smugness. She would never stoop to do what I do for our fighters. But I know of no higher service.\nSome fellow believers told me that during times of war we must forget the tender side of the Savored Sting and turn entirely to Her formidable, punishing image, for there is no place for love on the battlefield. But I do not agree. Here, everyone is ready to punish — but who, if not us, will bring love?\nWe kneel and I pray the Unquenchable Fire. My Lady! Take my eyes, for they can no longer witness the horrors of the war, or see beautiful bodies broken and torn asunder. No longer can they cry for our allies, friends, and lovers.\nAnd the Goddess replies: My child, your eyes are a priceless treasure. As a lighthouse safely guides ships back to land during the storm, the light in your eyes brings heroes back from the bloody storm of battle.\nAnd I pray: My Lady! Sew shut my lips, for I can no longer kiss the skin, which I know by dawn will be sliced, bitten, and peeled.\nAnd the goddess replies: My child, your lips are stronger than a sword and firmer than armor plate. The whisper of your prayer gives strength to the fighters and brings burning fire to the demons. The whisper of your prayer heals broken skin, so you may kiss it again.\nAnd I pray: My Lady! Burn out my heart! Let it find peace in the indifferent ash, for it can no longer withstand this pain.\nAnd the goddess replies: My beloved child! This pain is caused by the fire that burns in your heart. A fire so bright that everyone around it is comforted by its healing warmth. Do not dare turn to ash, but carry this heat to the very threshold of My chambers, where in the end you will find peace.\"",

Everyone froze; no one dared to disobey his order, even one given with his eyes alone. Lord Trezbot loved to say that he could only win when his whip frightened his soldiers more than the demons' claws — and he succeeded like no other in enforcing discipline.\nThe lord approached what we took for a scarecrow from afar, left in the middle of the wasteland by an unknown farmer. Pricking it with his sword, the lord made us a sign to approach. It was the body of a young crusader — a boy, not twenty years old. Horribly broken, disemboweled, with shards of bone sticking out and shreds of skin dangling in the wind. Horror watched us from the stake, eye sockets filled with worms.\nA contemptuous smirk crossed the lord's face. 'Coward.' He said through his teeth. 'Fled from the battle. The demons caught him and he surrendered without a fight. And here are his useless fellows!'\nThe lord kicked an inconspicuous bump under his feet, and it rolled, revealing an open helmet's visor with greenish-gray mush inside, swarming with insects. We shivered and looked down, realizing the ground underneath our feet was a mix of shards of metal and pieces of flesh.\n'Cowards.' The lord said again. 'Cowards and weaklings. They were doomed even before they approached the Worldwound. They should never have left their comfortable homes. What did they achieve? They delivered the demons a hot lunch, that's all. Let's go! While the slugs waste their useless lives, someone has to win this ridiculous war!'\nWithout turning away, or heeding the disgusting crunching sound underneath his feet, he strode forward. We hurried after him, trying not to step on anything that was until recently a part of a someone's body.\"",

This monstrosity spawned from the calcified remains of demon lord Colyphyr. His body became an island, his blood became crystals, and the disgusting ichor that seeped through the isle's crags gave life to a monster — a crystalline ooze of mythic proportions. Silent and unseen, the creature slid through the waves of Ishiar, waiting for airships. When spotting prey, its tendrils shot out of the water like monumental pillars and shattered decks into splinters. The translucent slime engulfed the sailors' bodies and slowly dissolved them. The Colorless One also attacked border settlements, devouring everything in its path and leaving nothing except bloody ooze and acid-scarred buildings behind. No weapon or spell could overcome this beast.\nFor Captain Kerz, hunting the Colorless One was a challenge. Stalking the beast in Ishiar for three years, he figured out that the Colorless One regularly returned to Colyphyr to recover its strength and drink from springs tainted with the ichor of its progenitor. Kerz set up an ambush next to one of such riverlets, catching the Colorless One unaware. He gave a signal, and the fire spells ignited, encircling the mound of predatory slime with an incendiary wall. The creature boiled, foamed, and raged in the trap but could not break out. The thing was dying… but too slowly. The fire magic ran its course, and the incendiary wall began to fade. The Colorless One attacked, grabbing the pirates, and devouring them one after the other.\nThe outcome of the fight hung by a thread when a flaming arrow streaked through the sky — it was \"Rabid Bitch,\" Captain Kerz's airship, and he was piloting her straight into the Colorless One. Her sails and her hull were ablaze, lit by the pirate's steady hand. The captain himself stood at the helm. The burning vessel struck the pile of slime like a battering ram, and an explosion shook the island. The monster's chunks were tossed hundreds of feet away, where they writhed helplessly and dried into crystalline powder.\nWafts of poisonous smoke rose to the sky and a toxic cloud swelled over the site of the explosion. And it was from that cloud that Captain Kerz triumphantly emerged — much to the joy of his remaining crew — covered in burns and sores left by the caustic slime, but alive and victorious. The tale of his hunt became a legend among the denizens of the Abyss, and the Colorless One became a small pile of crystallic refuse. However, it still retained a modicum of its terrifying power.",

It was he who captured the mysterious Collector that had been preying upon Alushinyrra's nobility and it was he who returned Ar-Mikheth's stolen golden carbuncle, but his most famous investigation is by far the case of the burning gladiators.\nOne day, a bunch of slaves stepped onto the sand of the Battlebliss arena unbidden. They were cloaked in flames but did not scream, silently carrying the bodies of their slain jailers on the tips of their spears. Having formed a column before the demons, awestruck at the sight, they spoke in a single voice: \"I have been taken from, so now I take.\" A moment later, they vanished in a conflagration that incinerated most of the spectators, leaving only charred words on the ashen floor of the arena: \"For pain and fire.\"\nThis incident was just the beginning. The killings in the arena continued, with gladiators seemingly losing their minds and attacking the guards, catching fire, and burning to ash alongside their tormentors. All that remained were the cryptic words: \"For pain and fire.\" Shamira the Ardent Dream commanded Djail to solve the mystery of these unusual deaths.\nDjail took a cup of blood and on every wall of the arena, wrote the following: \"I have taken from you. And I will take again.\" Having issued this challenge to the unknown killer, Djail waited — but not for long, because the bloody letters caught fire. Djail proclaimed he had solved the riddle and would reveal the answer to everyone on the next day. The next moment, a dozen thralls turned into pillars of flame and surrounded Djail. In a single voice, they asked: \"Do you think you have exposed me, demon? What do you even know, you arrogant fiend?\"\n\"I know your name. You are Nemarius, a demigod born of the goddess Sekhmet. You and your wife-to-be were captured and forced to fight to the death in the arena. She fell, and you set yourself on fire out of grief, but were never truly gone. Your spirit is bound to this object!\" Smiling, Djail presented the brand used to mark the slaves as the arena's property. \"I used my sorcerous sight to watch you light up my words, and I felt where the threads of your spells converge. This brand left its mark on your skin and the skin of your beloved bride. It was also used to mark the slaves whose minds you dominate and use as the instruments of your revenge. Or am I wrong?\"\nThe burning gladiators howled in Nemarius's voice, but it was too late. Djail cast a spell on the brand that trapped the vengeful demigod, defeating and disempowering his foe.\nThe tradition of using hot iron to mark the gladiators ceased, and the fate of Nemarius's brand remains unknown up to this very day.",

Local culture has an astounding way of combining reverence and devotion toward divine magic with disgust and fear toward its arcane counterparts. A Puluran astronomer is a respected position, yet mages that would be welcomed at any academy or school in Avistan are considered dangerous creatures that belong in one of the prison fortresses, such as the wicked Threshold.\nMost of the locals clammed up at the mere sight of me, unwilling to deal with a stranger from the 'land of heretics.' I even had to run for my life once or twice, when overly vigilant residents summoned the guards on me. But there were those who took their chances by speaking with me, an elf from the 'mad lands where mages walk among other people like proper citizens.' These brave souls helped me grasp the reason for this unusual disposition toward spellcasters, as the motives behind these superstitions are quite valid. In the eyes of the Sarkorians, priests are those who follow the strict code of their god and receive divine powers in return. Mages and sorcerers, on the other hand, are freaks of nature, abominations whose arcane powers are not subject to anything save for their own feeble mind and treacherous will.\nOf course, most of the enlightened Absalom residents, myself included, would find these beliefs barbaric and cruel. However, we have to take into account the complete lack of any schooling system for young spellcasters in Sarkoris. No one teaches the youth the basics of controlling their powers, the elementary incantation orthodoxy, or even any theory of moral obligations to themselves and others. It's no wonder that vulnerable young minds, having received powers of shocking proportions, often cross an unseen line and become monsters in the eyes of their own people.\nGiven this lamentable state of education and having seen for myself the consequences of a crazed mage roaming the outskirts of Iz, all I can do is confirm, with great regret, that the practice of imprisoning Sarkorian spellcasters bears the utmost pragmatic importance for this society.\"",

However, in the dark of the night they were attacked by a gang of demons and demon-worshiping cultists, who had edged into their rear. Though unskilled in battle, the clerics and healers fought desperately, repelling one attack after another, but the sides were not evenly matched. No one was left to repel the final attack — all of the Sarenrae adepts were wounded, no one was able to raise their sword, so they met the enemy with prayer. And a miracle happened — the morning broke an hour early, and the first rays of dawn expelled the demons into the Abyss. The light healed the most terrible wounds of the mortals and brought the fallen, whether righteous or sinful, back to life. Both the believers and the misguided shed their tears. They fell to their knees as one and prayed to the bright goddess for forgiveness. And forgiveness was granted, not a single mortal died on that bloody night. The last and the brightest ray of dawn blinded everyone and took the shape of the sacred symbol of Sarenrae. They named the relic the Faultless Daybreak and placed it on the breast of a statue mounted on the site where the miracle had happened.",

After that the digested spiritual essence of his prey peels away and falls to the ground in chunks of detestable smoldering scarlet slime. When these slimy chunks become hard as stone, the minions of Jubilex, the omoxes, collect the rocks and take them away. They then mold clay, dirt, and sand to form babies and then insert these slime stones, the gifts of their master, into their bodies. This way they turn the distorted, corroded soul-like substance into vile bodies. These creatures then grow and mature. This sinister brood of the Prince of Ooze inflicts terror on the world. The solitary eye in their heads is deployed by Jubilex to witness his offspring's deeds, should he become interested in the pathetic meddling of mere mortals.",

The bards call him the Face-Stealer, a great sage brought low by passion and hubris.\nLirk Ha'an believed he could answer any riddle, solve any mystery. Having heard about the wisdom of demon lord Areshkagal, he dared to challenge the Faceless Sphinx. Within a circle of twenty three candles, Lirk Ha'an chanted \"come and give me your most difficult riddle\" from dusk till dawn.\nWhen the last candle burned out, the dim light of the dawn revealed a woman wearing a bloody pharaoh's striped nemes. She handed a mirror mask to Lirk Ha'an.\n\"Don it, for it contains the riddle of the wise man's true face. Solve it, and boundless knowledge will be yours. But if you make a mistake, the mask will claim a part of your own visage.\"\nAs the woman vanished, Lirk Ha'an put on the mask and witnessed a conundrum of infinite complexity. He kept giving wrong answers time and again, making his face bleed like an open wound until his soul started to follow suit. Feeling his end draw near but unable to concede defeat, Lirk Ha'an embarked on a journey. He asked but a single question to every traveler he met, \"What is the wise man's true face?\" He repeated their answers, howled in pain, cruelly murdered them, and flayed their faces. Unable to move on, the souls of his victims surrounded him, covered his shoulders like a ghostly cloak, and drove him delirious with their whispers until the former sage became known in Sarkoris as the Face-Stealer. Lirk Ha'an quickly forgot who he was and only remembered the riddle he was supposed to solve.\nHe wandered the roads of Sarkoris for years until he met a renowned artificer named Xaria. The woman saw a tall gaunt figure emerge from the fog, wrapped in a shroud of spectral faces. The sage's voice cut through the barely audible murmur of lost souls: \"What is the wise man's true face?\"\nTrying to save herself, Xaria offered Lirk Ha'an her help. She promised the madman that she would create an artifact that would reveal his true visage. Lirk Ha'an brought her twenty-three dragon scales, no less and no more, a vial of prisoner blood, and the blade of an executioner's axe, then Xaria forged a blade of astonishing beauty.\n\"Wield it, and let the knife's edge show you the path to what you seek: the path to the wise man's true face,\" said she. But when the Face-Stealer touched the knife, the blade greedily plunged itself into his mask, shattering the mirror-like surface and releasing the souls of his victims into the sky. The faces Lirk Ha'an had stolen fell to the ground as useless clumps of flesh, leaving only a gory skull behind. The Face-Stealer perished, and wise Xaria hid the shattered mask so nobody else would fall prey to Areshkagal's gruesome riddle.",
    "e1db81e4-7e3f-45f9-8bc7-5a793563e8cf": "Little remains of the hidebound journal: the cover is tattered and half the pages are missing. Blank pages at the back of the book survive along with the final entries of the diary's unknown owner.\n\"After many days spent exploring the area and studying the traces left at the sites of the desecrated shrines, I at last struck upon the defilers' trail. My worst suspicions were confirmed: the cultist circle was led by a demodand, a creature from the bowels of the Abyss.\nThe clergy whose temples had been vandalized in the attacks were perplexed: what was the link between them? What did the shrines of Iomedae, Gorum, and Torag have in common? The answer was very simple: demodands hate all gods in equal measure and strive to destroy each and every shrine they come across. Alas, demodands do not always work alone: the one I was tracking had gathered a small coven around it, a gang of the deranged and depraved. What else can you call folk who'd let themselves be convinced of the vile tenets spewed by those beasts? For reference: demodands were created by titans who had been driven into the Abyss by the gods. Demodands' sole purpose is to serve their creators. They are blind slaves and tools of destruction, lacking even the smallest spark of that majesty granted to the faithful when they have contact with their divine patrons — whether it be Gorum or even the universally decried Rovagug. Mortals who convert to this faith of lies must be exterminated along with their false prophets. That is why we, the inquisitors of many deities, have banded together to hunt down such monsters in a joint effort.\nAfter covering a few dozen miles, I located the heretics' hidden lair: a dank cave deep in the forest. At sunrise tomorrow, I will make my way inside the cave to study the underground passages and sketch a map for our future raid. One should never underestimate demodands and their minions. I have no intention of attacking alone. But I can at least scout out the site of our coming attack, rather than sitting on my hands while my comrades muster a contingent and make their way here. Iomedae be with me.\"",

It was revealed that Mallander Linds had been practicing the forbidden, dark arts of magic, turning this knowledge against the demons. Shortly after the discovery, Linds decided to let the debate about his dubious methods rage on without him and secretly left Kenabres in the dead of night alongside a group of likeminded deserters. Thereafter, they waged their own war against demons, tracking down and destroying small enemy groups, but ultimately all the members of Mallander Linds's squad fell in battle. Scouts discovered evidence that, with each passing year, Linds had been descending ever deeper into his private Abyss of the dark arts. He would have sacrificed everything for victory, but the question still remains whether he was a hero or a traitor.",

The eldest of the late king's daughters, the good Galfrey, bravely took upon herself the burden of governing a country smitten with unrest and an uncertain future. An illustrious paladin and a shrewd leader, Galfrey rules over her subjects with dignity and grace to this day.\nThe year 4606 became a dark time for all of Golarion with the loss of Aroden's light, but for the northern reaches of Avistan, this tragedy was compounded by another calamity. That was when the heart of Sarkoris was torn open by a crack between worlds, the Worldwound, which later spread out to consume the country in its entirety. Mendev was destined to become the foremost protector of our world against the demon hordes. Its illustrious queen bolstered her ranks with warriors flocking to Mendev from all over Golarion, servants of Aroden who were determined to preserve their faith in this dark hour, and followers of a different, new goddess, Iomedae. Her armies faced the demonspawn and drove them back, away from Mendev's borders. And thus, the crusades were born, blessed by Iomedae and led by Galfrey, who now gained the Inheritor's favor.\"",
    "724bb0ce-4029-4175-983f-07a5f7c1b494": "Nerosyan, published by the Royal Court of Mendev\n\"Demons and their worshipers have long been active in the vicinity of Sarkoris. Even back in the year 4433, the Abyssal hordes and Aroden himself waged a grand battle in the region now known as the Worldwound. The forces of good had triumphed then, as the god of humanity defeated Deskari's minions and drove the surviving demons back — straight into the waters of the Lake of Mists and Veils.\nWhy did the denizens of the Abyss have such keen interest in the northern reaches of Avistan? To the dismay of all mortalkind, Areelu Vorlesh answered this question, and has consequently gone down in history as the Architect of the Worldwound and the Betrayer of Humanity. Born of humans, this fiend felt such hatred toward her own kind and was filled with such boundless selfishness that, for the sake of ascension and power, she pledged herself to the Abyssal lords. An adept of the arcane jailed by the Sarkorians in the prison-fortress of Threshold, she accomplished something that the Deskarites who perished in the Lake had failed at previously — she ripped apart the planar fabric that had been thin in Sarkoris since days of yore. Her thought and will thoroughly corrupted to mirror the foulest depths of the Abyss, Areelu Vorlesh forged a deplorable alliance with Deskari and began hatching the heinous plan that she put into motion in the year 4606. It was then that Areelu and her accomplices performed the ritual that cut open creation itself like a knife and left a festering tear in the Material Plane that would never heal — the Worldwound connecting Golarion with the Abyss.\nBy a tragic coincidence or perhaps by some evil intent, the Worldwound was created mere weeks after Aroden's death. Millions of Aroden's followers and priests across the world were filled with the horror and despair normally reserved to orphaned children, partially explaining why humanity did not realize there and then the sheer threat of the newly opened Sarkorian portal. Taking advantage of turmoil in the mortal world, Deskari drove his forces to attack the defenseless Sarkoris, and Areelu Vorlesh, who had been rewarded for her betrayal, started on her path toward demonic existence.\"",

There was a day when he was one of them, and his fame resounded from Varisia to Andoran. He traveled the world with a song and a smile, and a lovely wife at his side. He dreamt of creating the Song of All and spent years gathering sounds and notes for the melody that would encompass the entire Creation in supreme harmony. The laughter of a child and the confession of love, the triumphant cry and the gentle lullaby — all became sources for his inspiration. The journey brought the husband and wife to Drezen, where the great bard sang for the soldiers to inspire them before battle, but one night darkness descended upon Francest.\n\"You are gathering only the notes of joy, bard,\" it whispered mockingly. \"But there are so many other sounds you have never heard before,\" it murmured. \"Pay me with the blood of your love, and I will reveal them to you.\" Francest attempted to resist Nocticula's seductive voice, but to no avail — by dawn, his hand reached for the knife on its own accord.\nHe walked through the city streets covered in his wife's blood, singing a song with a happy smile on his face, and nobody dared to stop him — so terrifying and powerful was his voice. The call brought Francest to Alushinyrra where he kept gathering the notes to compose the Song of All: the cries of a mother whose children were butchered in front of her, the moans of a warrior whose hands were being chopped off, the wailing of lovers who would never see each other again. His cruelty astonished even demons. He murdered and tortured women and men, but the smile never left his face.\nYears went by, and the Song of All was almost complete. The Cursed Bard was lacking one final chord. He came to the Fleshmarkets and walked among slaves, treating them to sweet wine and even sweeter songs. The thralls watched him with hope and timid smiles. They gratefully accepted the cup he offered, but wine's tangy aftertaste quickly gave way to searing pain. The bard's wine casket was full of poison that liquefied innards, and the moans of the dying joined Francest's song as its final note.\nThe Cursed Bard drank the bitter dregs himself. He sang as he lay dying... and was happy. The demons listened to his performance with bated breath. It was the Song of All Wicked, a hymn to the darkest night where the cursed fire burns bright.\nWhen Francest fell silent, his body was reduced to rancid ooze. The poison spared only the bard's vocal cords, which the demons preserved as a grisly relic. They became a memento of the most frightful, the most remorseless song Alushinyrra ever heard.",

In the lands of the Worldwound, two demonic masters rule; learn to distinguish their influence and their followers.\nDeskari is a demon lord who commands locusts and other crawling pests. It is an all-devouring wave that sweeps away all that is bright, majestic, and pure, leaving behind nothing but decay and ashes. For a hundred years, this evil fiend and his lackeys have been sowing death and suffering all across Golarion, sending one horde after another through the Worldwound and onto our plane. Deskari's visage is hideous, for his essence is a horrid crossbreed of humanoid and insect, and behind his back are fluttering wings woven from swarms of insects. Born of two demons, Deskari despises both his brethren that were once mortal and his own human followers. Knowing of this disdain, the cleverest of his cultists seek ways to transform themselves into full-blooded demons, and to this end, they attempt some of the vilest experiments on their own flesh.\nDeskari has been behind the horrors of the Worldwound ever since its creation. However, the other demon lord, Baphomet, joined him only at the onset of the Third Crusade. The goat-headed demon lord is cunning and slippery, and where his unholy kin makes his way through brute force, Baphomet prefers deceit, corruption, and backstabbing. Many noble houses trying to preserve their veneer of exalted dynasties keep to the worship of Baphomet as a family tradition. In truth, the cultists who call themselves 'templars of the Ivory Labyrinth' are searching day and night for weaknesses in the crusader ranks — a doubtful mind to corrupt, a wavering heart to break, an ember of cowardice to fan. Beware of the cultists of Baphomet, for they might be standing next to you, looking over your shoulder and laughing at what you are reading.\"",

When the inquisitors caught up with him, Stevanius made an outrageous claim that his master, the valiant Zacharius, had also been practicing necromancy, using its dark secrets against the demons. Shortly afterward, Stevanius managed to escape, killing the warriors sent to arrest him. According to his journal, his next undertaking was a ritual that was supposed to transform him into a lich, an immortal master over the undead. The details of the ritual are now lost, but all the research into undeath points out that such potent magic cannot possibly exist. The tragic death of Stevanius the Rotten, who failed to achieve immortality and ended up a mindless undead, serves as yet further proof of this.",

As beautiful as she was depraved, this priestess was born into the family of the noble magician Conthyr. After he witnessed his daughter's disturbing inclinations, he sought to root out the little girl's taint through purifying rituals, but all of his efforts were for naught — Zaoris's heart was evil through and through. She hated her father and swore herself to the demon lord Nocticula, who gifted her with a magic pin that could seduce and enslave people's minds after it tasted a single drop of their blood. Zaoris used it to dominate Conthyr's will, then used his magic to bring death and destruction to the townsfolk of Katapesh. Her army grew day after day, as she used the pin to enthrall new servants.\nZaoris reveled in her cruelty, and her terror lasted for many years. She smiled as she handed weapons to children and promised them freedom if they spilled the blood of their fathers. She made sacrifices to Nocticula and forced her father Conthyr to incinerate entire settlements. And yet the magician managed to retain a few shreds of free will. Not wishing to serve evil, Conthyr tricked his daughter into exploring an abandoned temple of Calistria, the goddess of lust and vengeance. Tempted by treasure and unaware that the temple was cursed, Zaoris agreed, and so she and her father set out to meet their doom — together.\nThe temple's most precious treasure was the Book of Redemption. Clad in a cover of gold and jewels, it was magnificent. Zaoris thought the book contained destructive spells, but realized her mistake the moment she opened it. All the braziers in the abandoned temple flared up, and crimson words seeped onto an empty page — the Book of Redemption chronicled Zaoris's guilty acts in blood. The priestess cried out in unbearable pain as the curse struck her — any murderer who entered the temple fell prey to their own crimes, endlessly experiencing the agony felt by each of their victims. The temple doors slammed shut and the magic of the pin faded. Zaoris and Conthyr found themselves trapped at the altar.\nDelirious with pain, the priestess stabbed her father to death with the disempowered pin and then pierced her own heart, but her spirit found no rest in the afterlife. The agonized face of the priestess kept haunting the subsequent owners of the pin for years, and even after the cursed item found its way back to Nocticula, Zaoris the Crimson refused to vanish for good.",

The demons could not harm Sulema, for he was strong and experienced. But it was not claws or blades the druid should have been afraid of. Each day that he witnessed the torments of nature and the terrible wounds inflicted on Golarion, his mind was slowly poisoned by madness. A year later, the druid's appearance was said to be frightful, his hair clotted and covered with mildew, his majestic staff twisted and matted with toadstools and withered vines. Sulema came to believe in the death of all creation. His feverish fantasies began to visualize the natural cycle of life and death as horrific torment yielding only dust and excretia. The druid that had restored life began instead to disfigure and poison the natural world. Thenceforth, wherever he went, he spread the disease, accompanied by a pack of venomous beasts. Sulema became a prophet of pestilence and a herald of blight and putrefaction. The mere touch of his staff brought madness and decay.",

Kearius was a servant of Desna who was in charge of the temple shelter, but secretly worshiped the Lord of Beasts. He took advantage of his position to build a cunning maze in the temple's secret basement and filled it with fierce and bloodthirsty monsters. Each night, Kearius cast an overly trusting vagabond or a homeless person into the maze, where they met their grisly end.\nThe cultist spread heresy and depravity, corrupting the other priests. Baphomet took note of his servant's guile and bestowed an incredible gift upon him — a spark of the flame gracing the brow of the Lord of Monsters himself. The lantern containing this spark could summon fiery denizens of the Abyss, and its swaying could hypnotize or conjure terrifying illusions. Kearius enshrined the flame of his lord and master at the very heart of his maze.\nBut soon enough, an incredible thing happened. A lonely beggar boy — a frail and timid creature — fell into Kearius' clutches and was cast down into the maze. Somehow, he managed to survive and reach the very center of the trap. He reached out for the flame with his scraggly hands and was gone. Frightened and furious, Kearius found the empty shrine and set out to pursue the pilferer. He feared that Baphomet might learn about this failure and punish his negligent servant.\nAfter a while, he learned of entire villages reduced to ash by fiery creatures, with the survivors driven insane by the eerie glow of a sinister flame. They raved and rambled about a frail beggar boy with hellish fire in the palm of his hands.\nKearius tracked the young man down. Fear tugged at his heart and nudged him toward madness. When he finally reached the boy, the beggar laughed and turned into a cocky young man, decked in the garb of a Baphomet cultist. The grinning rogue said it was the Lord of Monsters himself who had inspired him to steal the unholy flame, and even devised the guise of the feeble child. Kearius's failure would be his downfall, and the sneaky thief would take his place as Baphomet's most loyal servant. A fight broke out where both demon worshipers sought to destroy one another, but neither could gain the upper hand. When they became tired, the Lord of Beasts' flame slipped from the thief's sweaty hands and fell onto a pile of dead branches. Fiery creatures emerged from the fire and surrounded the weakened priests, the monsters' eyes glowing like embers. The cultists pleaded with their master for protection, but their appeals fell on deaf ears. The spawn of Baphomet's flame feasted on the sinners' flesh all night, and when the fire burned out, only a tiny spark of the unholy flame was left smoldering among the remains.",

Zurga was born with a body so twisted and broken that the infant's very survival seemed truly miraculous. The diseases and curses afflicting the wretched creature were so strong that no amount of healing magic could undo them. Zurga grew up to become a violent, rancorous man who despised love, friendship, and everything pure and kind. He turned all the hatred he had amassed over the years against the world that had humiliated him and dedicated himself fully to the bloody ways of Gorum. Even his fellow priests considered Zurga to be irredeemably broken and evil, which in turn made him abandon them and turn to Rovagug instead. Dreaming of total annihilation, the triumphant revenge for his suffering, Zurga gathered his own band of rascals, driven together out of fear, to commit brutal robberies and murder. The government of Sarkoris sent their militia squads eastwards to bring Zurga and his cohorts to justice, but the disaster struck when the Worldwound opened and their quest was curtailed. The Humpback was among the few madmen who were not afraid of the demonic incursion; he even managed to turn the situation to his advantage by cowing some demon worshipers into submission. Zurga made them forget their former masters by demonstrating his unrivaled malevolent strength and pursued his own unholy crusade.\nEven his own allies were not safe from his wrath, and eventually this became his undoing. Humpback Zurga was killed in his sleep by a group of treacherous followers. Legend has it that although they cut his throat precisely at midnight, the sinister brute of a priest continued to spit out profanities and curses until the first light of day.",

Legend has it, that the people of the Bloodwood tribe pursued by the spawn of the Abyss walked through the wilds for days. Soon their strength left them and fear filled their hearts. When cruel death seemed inevitable, the old shaman summoned his fellow tribesmen and commanded them to take each other by the hand and stand united side by side. He promised that he would protect them from pain and anguish and offer them the opportunity to witness the eradication of the demon scourge to pay the bloody debt of revenge. The shaman performed a mysterious ritual, and all who had gathered became one, transforming into a giant ash tree that propped up the sky. The demons following the Sarkorians' trail did not find a living soul and howled in dismay. They burned down the forest and uprooted the trees, before turning their ire on the ash, but the tree was too tall and mighty for them to fell. When the creatures of the Abyss left with nothing, a boy, the only member of the Bloodwood tribe who, for some reason, had been untouched by the shaman's magic, jumped down from the tree and took his leave. He survived to pass on the legend of the Last Ash to future generations. Every ten years, his descendants would make their way into the Worldwound to the roots of the great tree and honor the memory of his fellow tribesmen. A map showing the path to this secret site had been passed down in their family for generations. All who came to the Last Ash heard the same whisper drifting through the leaves: \"The last branch will be the witness of the end of demonic rule.\" Alas, as years went by, their belief in these words grew weaker and the tree, wounded by the demons, slowly began to die. It is said to have turned into a huge stump with only one branch left. And if the tree dies before the Worldwound is defeated, the power of demons will never leave these lands.",
