Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of {g|Encyclopedia:Feat}feats{/g} such as Weapon Focus. The kineticist is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast, and she can't use Vital Strike feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any {g|Encyclopedia:Size}size{/g} (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms).\nEach simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast.\nPhysical blasts are {g|Encyclopedia:RangedAttack}ranged attacks{/g} that deal an amount of damage equal to {g|Encyclopedia:Dice}1d6{/g}+1 + the kineticist's {g|Encyclopedia:Constitution}Constitution{/g} modifier, increasing by 1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. {g|Encyclopedia:Spell_Resistance}Spell resistance{/g} doesn't apply against physical blasts.\nEnergy blasts are ranged {g|Encyclopedia:TouchAttack}touch attacks{/g} that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist's Constitution modifier, increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.\nComposite blasts combine elements to form a new blast.

She gains additional infusions at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 17th, and 19th levels. By using infusions along with her kinetic blasts, a kineticist can alter her kinetic blasts to suit her needs. Infusions come in two types, each of which changes a kinetic blast differently: a substance infusion causes an additional effect, while a form infusion causes the kinetic blast to manifest in a different way. Each infusion can alter only certain kinds of kinetic blasts, which are listed in its Associated Blasts entry. Each time the kineticist uses one of her kinetic blast wild talents, she can apply up to one associated form infusion and up to one associated substance infusion.\nSome infusions change the {g|Encyclopedia:CA_Types}action{/g} required to activate a kinetic blast or entirely transform the kinetic blast's normal effects.\nThe burn cost listed in each infusion's Burn entry is added to the burn cost of the kinetic blast the infusion modifies.\nThe {g|Encyclopedia:DC}DC{/g} for a {g|Encyclopedia:Saving_Throw}save{/g} against an infusion is based on the associated kinetic blast's effective {g|Encyclopedia:Spell}spell{/g} level, not the level of the infusion.

When a kineticist modifies a kinetic blast with a form infusion and a substance infusion that both require saving throws, each target first attempts a saving throw against the form infusion.

Deskari's cult is most powerful in the lands that once made up the realm of Sarkoris. Outside of the Worldwound, his cults have spread into other northern nations infecting the nearby lands of Mendev, Numeria and Brevoy. Many of Deskari's cultists worship him in the hope of being rewarded when he takes over the world, but Deskari sees them as no more than pawns.

Instead of gods, they tend to revere ideals such as goodness or freedom, philosophies such as the Prophecies of Kalistrade or diabolism, or nothing in particular. Some scholars argue that the term \"atheist\" is incorrectly applied to these people, preferring terms such as \"dystheists\" or \"misotheists.\" Others call themselves \"agnostics,\" insisting that no mortal can say what is divine and what isn't, as the workings of the divine are fundamentally unknowable by mortals. However, such distinctions are lost on a generally religious society, and most accept the more common term.\nAtheism is looked down upon in many parts of Golarion, but is enforced on a state level in the nations of Rahadoum in Garund, Touvette in the River Kingdoms, and Bachuan in Tian Xia.\nDespite their lack of faith, atheists' souls are still judged by Pharasma.
