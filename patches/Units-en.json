I don't know when you will read them, or if you will ever get the chance — I am writing to you from a city besieged by a demonic horde, in the last crusader stronghold, minutes before the battle that may very well be our last. I have put off writing this account year after year, but now that I can feel death breathing down my neck, I thought it was finally time to pick up a quill.\nI don't doubt that in our noble family, my name is either mired in disgrace or consigned to obscurity. I am called a coward and a traitor, one who forsook his homeland and his family. It doesn't matter to me. As I see it, I owe nothing to the Great House Garess — they gave me life, yes, but they took my childhood and my youth, denying me love and friendship, joy and happiness. I owe them nothing. But to you, my son, I owe the truth.\nI never loved your mother, nor she me — marriages amongst the nobility are not brokered for love. When a Brevic aristocrat says the word 'love,' he means 'obedience.' It was in the name of 'love' that your great-grandfather bid me 'love' that woman — and I obeyed, to my sorrow and hers. I comforted myself with the hope that our union would prove fruitless, for I knew I would be unable to give you anything but that same northern 'love' — that cold cruelty that speaks its name in screams and floggings.\nI resolved to flee when I understood everything with clarity: Brevoy was doomed to civil war. For too long had its two halves, Rostland and Issia, suffered under the yoke of this forced marriage, as your own parents had. I counted among my friends many heroes of Restov who bore the illustrious name Aldori. I knew I would be forced to raise my sword against them when the Great Houses decided to destroy the very thought of an independent Rostland. It was a burden I knew I could not bear.\nI turned my back on my homeland and my family and fled to Mendev to join the crusaders. Whatever horrors awaited me in a war against evil incarnate, they could not be more terrifying than the fratricidal slaughter that was coming for Brevoy. In Mendev I could be sure who my friends were and who was the enemy. Here I need not wonder if I am fighting for a just cause. Here is where I learned what love is, real love.\nGoodbye, my son. Know that I regret nothing. I found my truth — I hope you will find yours.\nQuilessy Garess,\nFoot Soldier of the Crusader Army of Her Majesty Queen Galfrey of Mendev\"",

From the lore of numerous races come tales of these muses, particularly those that have taken a vested interest in the training of a single talented prodigy or the ongoing creation of some fantastic work of art. Such legends sometimes prove true, as all lillends have their favorite works, creations, and artists, and often visit the Material Plane to enjoy their splendor and make sure they remain safe.

Most phantom armors haunt the halls and blasted battlefields where they were slain, seeking revenge against their murderers or, should that prove impossible, confronting any living creature that might give them the opportunity to do battle once more. Dastardly necromancers have also discovered the process for binding violent spirits to suits of armor, giving rise to eerie servants that combine endless patience with cold brutality. Phantom armors come in many shapes and sizes; some appear to be nothing more than animate helms while others resemble armored giants.",
